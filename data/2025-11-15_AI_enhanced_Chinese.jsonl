As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d1\u73b0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4eff\u771f\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u4eff\u771f\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08sim-to-real gap\uff09\uff0c\u4ee5\u786e\u4fdd\u4eff\u771f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u5b9a\u4e49\u6807\u8bb0\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u62bd\u8c61\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5339\u914d\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u67e5\u8be2\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u5feb\u901f\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u5339\u914d\u7279\u5b9a\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728\u67e5\u8be2\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u89c6\u89c9\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u4e14\u901f\u5ea6\u66f4\u5feb\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u968f\u7740\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u65f6\u957f\u6269\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4eff\u771f\u5931\u8d25\u573a\u666f\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

In this work, we introduce Generative Adversarial Distillation (GAD), which enables on-policy and black-box distillation. GAD frames the student LLM as a generator and trains a discriminator to distinguish its responses from the teacher LLM's, creating a minimax game. The discriminator acts as an on-policy reward model that co-evolves with the student, providing stable, adaptive feedback. Experimental results show that GAD consistently surpasses the commonly used sequence-level knowledge distillation. In particular, Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct (student) trained with GAD becomes comparable to its teacher, GPT-5-Chat, on the LMSYS-Chat automatic evaluation.

However, the presence of outliers in weights and activations often leads to large quantization errors and severe accuracy degradation, especially in recent reasoning LLMs where errors accumulate across long chains of thought. Existing PTQ methods either fail to sufficiently suppress outliers or introduce significant overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose Pairwise Rotation Quantization (ParoQuant), a weight-only PTQ method that combines hardware-efficient and optimizable independent Givens rotations with channel-wise scaling to even out the magnitude across channels and narrow the dynamic range within each quantization group. We further co-design the inference kernel to fully exploit GPU parallelism and keep the rotations and scaling lightweight at runtime. ParoQuant achieves an average 2.4% accuracy improvement over AWQ on reasoning tasks with less than 10% overhead. This paves the way for more efficient and accurate deployment of reasoning LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "ParoQuant\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6743\u91cd\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u901a\u9053\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u56e0\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u548c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPairwise Rotation Quantization\uff08ParoQuant\uff09\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u72ec\u7acb\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u901a\u9053\u7f29\u653e\uff0c\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u7ec4\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u6bd4AWQ\u63d0\u53472.4%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f00\u9500\u5c0f\u4e8e10%\u3002", "conclusion": "ParoQuant\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u578b\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u51c6\u786e\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u65b0\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}
