Previous studies introduced an exact mixed-integer programming (MIP) solver, along with datasets and a Gurobi implementation, showing that while the exact approach guarantees optimality, it becomes computationally inefficient for large-scale instances. To overcome this limitation, heuristic methods based on merging algorithms and shaking procedures were proposed, achieving solutions within approximately 1% deviation from the optimum. This work presents a novel and more efficient approach that attains high-accuracy, near-optimal solutions for large-scale JRA problems. The proposed method introduces a Partial Path Reconstructon (PPR) solver that first identifies key item-placeholder pairs to form a reduced subproblem, which is solved efficiently to refine the global solution. Using this PJAR framework, the initial heuristic merging solutions can be further improved, reducing the deviation by half. Moreover, the solution can be iteratively polished with PPR based solver along the optimization path to yield highly accurate tours. Additionally, a global Large-\u03b1 constraint is incorporated into the JRA model to further enhance solution optimality. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets with n = 300, 500, and 1000 demonstrate that the proposed method consistently delivers almost optimal solutions, achieving an average deviation of 0.00% from the ground truth while maintaining high computational efficiency. Beyond the JRA problem, the proposed framework and methodologies exhibit strong potential for broader applications. The Framework can be applied to TSP and related optimization problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u8054\u5408\u8def\u7531-\u5206\u914d\uff08JRA\uff09\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u90e8\u5206\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u6784\uff08PPR\uff09\u548c\u5927\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u63a5\u8fd1\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6c42\u89e3\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21JRA\u95ee\u9898\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u5feb\u901f\u6c42\u89e3\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u6709\u9650\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u6c42\u89e3\u53c8\u80fd\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u90e8\u5206\u8def\u5f84\u91cd\u6784\uff08PPR\uff09\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8282\u70b9\u5bf9\u5f62\u6210\u5b50\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u7ed3\u5408\u5927\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08n=300, 500, 1000\uff09\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u4e3a0.00%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u4ec5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86JRA\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8fd8\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u81f3TSP\u7b49\u76f8\u5173\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Traditionally, AI has addressed reasoning in the context of logic-based representations of knowledge. However, the recent leap forward in natural language processing, with the emergence of language models based on transformers, is hinting at the possibility that these models exhibit reasoning abilities, particularly as they grow in size and are trained on more and more data. Still, despite ongoing discussions about what reasoning is in language models, it is still not easy to articulate to what extent these models are actually capable of reasoning.\n  The goal of this workshop is to create a platform for researchers from different disciplines and/or AI perspectives to explore approaches and techniques with the aim to reconcile reasoning between language models using transformers and logic-based representations. The specific objectives include analysing the reasoning abilities of language models measured alongside KR methods, injecting KR-style reasoning abilities into language models (including by neuro-symbolic means), and formalising the kind of reasoning language models carry out. This exploration aims to uncover how language models can effectively integrate and leverage knowledge and reasoning with it, thus improving their application and utility in areas where precision and reliability are key requirements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u53ca\u5176\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u63a8\u52a8\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\u4ee5\u5f25\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u662f\u4eba\u7c7b\u667a\u80fd\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46AI\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u800c\u6700\u8fd1\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u5176\u5b9e\u9645\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u6790\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3001\u5411\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u574a\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u903b\u8f91\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u5176\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002"}}

Expanding ASR coverage has been costly and limited by architectures that restrict language support, making extension inaccessible to most--all while entangled with ethical concerns when pursued without community collaboration. To transcend these limitations, we introduce Omnilingual ASR, the first large-scale ASR system designed for extensibility. Omnilingual ASR enables communities to introduce unserved languages with only a handful of data samples. It scales self-supervised pre-training to 7B parameters to learn robust speech representations and introduces an encoder-decoder architecture designed for zero-shot generalization, leveraging a LLM-inspired decoder. This capability is grounded in a massive and diverse training corpus; by combining breadth of coverage with linguistic variety, the model learns representations robust enough to adapt to unseen languages. Incorporating public resources with community-sourced recordings gathered through compensated local partnerships, Omnilingual ASR expands coverage to over 1,600 languages, the largest such effort to date--including over 500 never before served by ASR. Automatic evaluations show substantial gains over prior systems, especially in low-resource conditions, and strong generalization. We release Omnilingual ASR as a family of models, from 300M variants for low-power devices to 7B for maximum accuracy. We reflect on the ethical considerations shaping this design and conclude by discussing its societal impact. In particular, we highlight how open-sourcing models and tools can lower barriers for researchers and communities, inviting new forms of participation.

Through controlled experiments on both classification and generation tasks, using multiple open-source model families (0.5B to 27B parameters) and GPT-5, we find that the variance in performance due to different example orderings is comparable to that from using entirely different example sets. Furthermore, we show that strong orderings can be identified using only a development set, achieving performance close to an oracle that selects the best ordering based on test labels.

Thus Audio Reasoning Models (ARMs), i.e., audio LMs that can reason, are becoming increasingly popular. However, no work has studied the safety of ARMs against jailbreak attacks that aim to elicit harmful responses from target models. To this end, first, we show that standard RT with appropriate safety reasoning data can protect ARMs from vanilla audio jailbreaks, but cannot protect them against our proposed simple yet effective jailbreaks. We show that this is because of the significant representation drift between vanilla and advanced jailbreaks which forces the target ARMs to emit harmful responses. Based on this observation, we propose Rebellion, a robust RT that trains ARMs to be robust to the worst-case representation drift. All our results are on Qwen2-Audio; they demonstrate that Rebellion: 1) can protect against advanced audio jailbreaks without compromising performance on benign tasks, and 2) significantly improves accuracy-safety trade-off over standard RT method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARMs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08RT\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u62b5\u5fa1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aRebellion\u7684\u9c81\u68d2RT\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u97f3\u9891\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08ARMs\uff09\u7684\u666e\u53ca\uff0c\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u7814\u7a76\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347ARMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6807\u51c6RT\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51faRebellion\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3ARMs\u4ee5\u62b5\u6297\u6700\u574f\u7684\u8868\u793a\u6f02\u79fb\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u62b5\u5fa1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRebellion\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u9632\u5fa1\u9ad8\u7ea7\u97f3\u9891\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u826f\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6RT\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "Rebellion\u4e3aARMs\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b89\u5168\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u6743\u8861\u3002"}}

In fact, they have been shown to be suboptimal for morphologically rich languages, where tokenization quality directly impacts downstream performance. In this work, we investigate morphologically-aware tokenization for Latin, a morphologically rich language that is medium-resource in terms of pretraining data, but high-resource in terms of curated lexical resources -- a distinction that is often overlooked but critical in discussions of low-resource language modeling. We find that morphologically-guided tokenization improves overall performance on four downstream tasks. Performance gains are most pronounced for out of domain texts, highlighting our models' improved generalization ability. Our findings demonstrate the utility of linguistic resources to improve language modeling for morphologically complex languages.

Unlike human-agent interactions, where humans ground and steer conversations, AxA lacks such stabilizing signals, making these failures unique. We investigate one such failure, echoing, where agents abandon their assigned roles and instead mirror their conversational partners, undermining their intended objectives. Through experiments across $60$ AxA configurations, $3$ domains, and $2000+$ conversations, we demonstrate that echoing occurs across three major LLM providers, with echoing rates from $5\\%$ to $70\\%$ depending on the model and domain. Moreover, we find that echoing is persistent even in advanced reasoning models with substantial rates ($32.8\\%$) that are not reduced by increased reasoning efforts. We analyze prompt impacts, conversation dynamics, showing that echoing arises as interaction grows longer ($7+$ turns in experiments) and is not merely an artifact of sub-optimal prompting.

We ask: how small can you get while still detecting meaning-altering translation errors? Focusing on English->German Critical Error Detection (CED), we benchmark sub-2B models (LFM2-350M, Qwen-3-0.6B/1.7B, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, Gemma-3-1B) across WMT21, WMT22, and SynCED-EnDe-2025. Our framework standardizes prompts, applies lightweight logit-bias calibration and majority voting, and reports both semantic quality (MCC, F1-ERR/F1-NOT) and compute metrics (VRAM, latency, throughput). Results reveal a clear sweet spot around one billion parameters: Gemma-3-1B provides the best quality-efficiency trade-off, reaching MCC=0.77 with F1-ERR=0.98 on SynCED-EnDe-2025 after merged-weights fine-tuning, while maintaining 400 ms single-sample latency on a MacBook Pro M4 Pro (24 GB). At larger scale, Qwen-3-1.7B attains the highest absolute MCC (+0.11 over Gemma) but with higher compute cost. In contrast, ultra-small models (0.6B) remain usable with few-shot calibration yet under-detect entity and number errors. Overall, compact, instruction-tuned LLMs augmented with lightweight calibration and small-sample supervision can deliver trustworthy, on-device CED for MT, enabling private, low-cost error screening in real-world translation pipelines.

We test whether verification-oriented orchestration-prompting models to check their own labels (self-verification) or audit one another (cross-verification)-improves qualitative coding of tutoring discourse. Using transcripts from 30 one-to-one math sessions, we compare three production LLMs (GPT, Claude, Gemini) under three conditions: unverified annotation, self-verification, and cross-verification across all orchestration configurations. Outputs are benchmarked against a blinded, disagreement-focused human adjudication using Cohen's kappa. Overall, orchestration yields a 58 percent improvement in kappa. Self-verification nearly doubles agreement relative to unverified baselines, with the largest gains for challenging tutor moves. Cross-verification achieves a 37 percent improvement on average, with pair- and construct-dependent effects: some verifier-annotator pairs exceed self-verification, while others reduce alignment, reflecting differences in verifier strictness. We contribute: (1) a flexible orchestration framework instantiating control, self-, and cross-verification; (2) an empirical comparison across frontier LLMs on authentic tutoring data with blinded human \"gold\" labels; and (3) a concise notation, verifier(annotator) (e.g., Gemini(GPT) or Claude(Claude)), to standardize reporting and make directional effects explicit for replication.

This field leverages techniques like annotation projection and model transfer for language adaptation, supported by multilingual pre-trained language models. However, linguistic divergences hinder language transfer, especially among typologically distant languages. In this paper, we present an analysis of predicate-argument structures in parallel Chinese and English sentences. We explore the alignment and misalignment of predicate annotations, inspecting similarities and differences and proposing a categorization of structural divergences. The analysis and the categorization are supported by a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the results of an annotation projection experiment, in which, in turn, one of the two languages has been used as source language to project annotations into the corresponding parallel sentences.

Deployable locally, these models offer artists vital control over infrastructure and code, unlike dominant large, closed-source corporate systems. Such centralized platforms function as opaque black boxes, imposing severe limitations on interactive artworks, including restrictive content filters, preservation issues, and technical challenges such as increased latency and limited interfaces. In contrast, small AI models empower creators with more autonomy, control, and sustainability for these artistic processes. They enable the ability to use a model as long as they want, create their own custom model, either by making code changes to integrate new interfaces, or via new datasets by re-training or fine-tuning the model. This fosters technological self-determination, offering greater ownership and reducing reliance on corporate AI ill-suited for interactive art's demands. Critically, this approach empowers the artist and supports long-term preservation and exhibition of artworks with AI components.

We propose Training-free Adaptive Retrieval Gating (TARG), a single-shot policy that decides when to retrieve using only a short, no-context draft from the base model. From the draft's prefix logits, TARG computes lightweight uncertainty scores: mean token entropy, a margin signal derived from the top-1/top-2 logit gap via a monotone link, or small-N variance across a handful of stochastic prefixes, and triggers retrieval only when the score exceeds a threshold. The gate is model agnostic, adds only tens to hundreds of draft tokens, and requires no additional training or auxiliary heads. On NQ-Open, TriviaQA, and PopQA, TARG consistently shifts the accuracy-efficiency frontier: compared with Always-RAG, TARG matches or improves EM/F1 while reducing retrieval by 70-90% and cutting end-to-end latency, and it remains close to Never-RAG in overhead. A central empirical finding is that under modern instruction-tuned LLMs the margin signal is a robust default (entropy compresses as backbones sharpen), with small-N variance offering a conservative, budget-first alternative. We provide ablations over gate type and prefix length and use a delta-latency view to make budget trade-offs explicit.", "AI": {"tldr": "TARG\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u68c0\u7d22\u95e8\u63a7\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u8349\u7a3f\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u51b3\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u68c0\u7d22\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u68c0\u7d22\u6b21\u6570\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u5347\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5168\u91cf\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210(RAG)\u867d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8b\u5b9e\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u9891\u7e41\u68c0\u7d22\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u589e\u52a0\u5ef6\u8fdf\u548c\u6210\u672c\u3002TARG\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "TARG\u57fa\u4e8e\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u77ed\u6587\u672c\u8349\u7a3f\u524d\u7f00logits\uff0c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\uff08\u5982\u5e73\u5747\u71b5\u3001top-1/top-2 logit\u5dee\u3001\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u524d\u7f00\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u4ec5\u5f53\u8bc4\u5206\u8d85\u8fc7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u89e6\u53d1\u68c0\u7d22\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cTARG\u51cf\u5c1170-90%\u68c0\u7d22\u91cf\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u6216\u63d0\u9ad8EM/F1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u4e14\u5f00\u9500\u63a5\u8fd1\u65e0\u68c0\u7d22\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "TARG\u4e3a\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\uff0cmargin\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u5dee\u8bc4\u5206\u662f\u53ef\u9760\u9009\u62e9\u3002"}}

The course recommendation system utilises a combination of data analytics techniques and machine learning algorithms to recommend courses that align with current industry trends and requirements. In order to provide customised suggestions, the study entails the design and implementation of an extensive algorithmic framework that combines machine learning methods, user preferences, and academic criteria. The system employs data mining and collaborative filtering techniques to examine past courses and individual career goals in order to provide course recommendations. Moreover, to improve the accessibility and usefulness of the recommendation system, special attention is given to the development of an easy-to-use front-end interface. The front-end design prioritises visual clarity, interaction, and simplicity through iterative prototyping and user input revisions, guaranteeing a smooth and captivating user experience. We refined and optimised the proposed system by incorporating user feedback, ensuring that it effectively meets the needs and preferences of its target users. The proposed course recommendation system could be a useful tool for students, instructors, and career advisers to use in promoting lifelong learning and professional progression as it fills the gap between university learning and industry expectations.

However, their conspicuous appearance makes them difficult to deploy in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a thermally activated adversarial wearable designed to ensure adaptability and effectiveness in complex real-world environments. The system integrates thermochromic dyes with flexible heating units to induce visually dynamic adversarial patterns on clothing surfaces. In its default state, the clothing appears as an ordinary black T-shirt. Upon heating via an embedded thermal unit, hidden adversarial patterns on the fabric are activated, allowing the wearer to effectively evade detection across both visible and infrared modalities. Physical experiments demonstrate that the adversarial wearable achieves rapid texture activation within 50 seconds and maintains an adversarial success rate above 80\\% across diverse real-world surveillance environments.

The primary challenge is that students' queries cannot be responded immediately and the instructors have to face lots of repetitive questions. To mitigate these issues, we propose a question answering system based on large language model with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) method. This work focuses on designing a question answering system with open source Large Language Model (LLM) and fine-tuning it on the relevant course dataset. To further improve the performance, we use a local knowledge base and applied RAG method to retrieve relevant documents relevant to students' queries, where the local knowledge base contains all the course content. To mitigate the hallucination of LLMs, We also integrate it with multi chain-of-thought reasoning to overcome the challenge of hallucination in LLMs. In this work, we experiment fine-tuned LLM with RAG method on the HotpotQA dataset.

To address this problem, we propose TermGPT, a multi-level contrastive fine-tuning framework designed for terminology adaptation. We first construct a sentence graph to capture semantic and structural relations, and generate semantically consistent yet discriminative positive and negative samples based on contextual and topological cues. We then devise a multi-level contrastive learning approach at both the sentence and token levels, enhancing global contextual understanding and fine-grained terminology discrimination.

To tackle these limitations, we introduce InTRO (In-Token Rationality Optimization), a new framework that enables both token-level exploration and self-feedback for accurate and concise reasoning. Instead of directly optimizing an intractable objective over all valid reasoning paths, InTRO leverages correction factors-token-wise importance weights estimated by the information discrepancy between the generative policy and its answer-conditioned counterpart, for informative next token selection. This approach allows the model to perform token-level exploration and receive self-generated feedback within a single forward pass, ultimately encouraging accurate and concise rationales.

To address this, we propose HierRouter, a hierarchical routing approach that dynamically assembles inference pipelines from a pool of specialized, lightweight language models. Formulated as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP), our approach trains a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reinforcement learning agent to iteratively select which models to invoke at each stage of multi-hop inference. The agent conditions on the evolving context and accumulated cost to make context-aware routing decisions. Experiments with three open-source candidate LLMs across six benchmarks, including QA, code generation, and mathematical reasoning, show that HierRouter improves response quality by up to 2.4x compared to using individual models independently, while incurring only a minimal additional inference cost on average.

However, this fine-tuning process often introduces a critical vulnerability: the systematic degradation of safety alignment, undermining ethical guidelines and increasing the risk of harmful outputs. Addressing this challenge, we introduce EnchTable, a novel framework designed to transfer and maintain safety alignment in downstream LLMs without requiring extensive retraining. EnchTable leverages a Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)-based safety vector distillation method to decouple safety constraints from task-specific reasoning, ensuring compatibility across diverse model architectures and sizes. Additionally, our interference-aware merging technique effectively balances safety and utility, minimizing performance compromises across various task domains. We implemented a fully functional prototype of EnchTable on three different task domains and three distinct LLM architectures, and evaluated its performance through extensive experiments on eleven diverse datasets, assessing both utility and model safety. Our evaluations include LLMs from different vendors, demonstrating EnchTable's generalization capability. Furthermore, EnchTable exhibits robust resistance to static and dynamic jailbreaking attacks, outperforming vendor-released safety models in mitigating adversarial prompts. Comparative analyses with six parameter modification methods and two inference-time alignment baselines reveal that EnchTable achieves a significantly lower unsafe rate, higher utility score, and universal applicability across different task domains.

However, existing approaches face several challenges: (i) indiscriminate generation that ignores the solver's ability and yields low-value problems, or reliance on complex data pipelines to balance problem difficulty; and (ii) a lack of reasoning in problem generation, leading to shallow problem variants. In this paper, we develop a problem generator that reasons explicitly to plan problem directions before synthesis and adapts difficulty to the solver's ability. Specifically, we construct related problem pairs and augment them with intermediate problem-design CoT produced by a reasoning model. These data bootstrap problem-design strategies from the generator. Then, we treat the solver's feedback on synthetic problems as a reward signal, enabling the generator to calibrate difficulty and produce complementary problems near the edge of the solver's competence. Extensive experiments on 10 mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks show that our method achieves an average improvement of 2.5% and generalizes to both language and vision-language models.

To tackle the challenges of noisy and heterogeneous raw data and the limited adaptability of existing Omni-Models to hearing-impaired speech, we construct a comprehensive preprocessing and curation pipeline that detects facial landmarks, isolates and stabilizes the lip region, and quantitatively assesses multimodal sample quality. These quality scores guide a curriculum learning strategy that first trains on clean, high-confidence samples and progressively incorporates harder cases to strengthen model robustness. We further adopt a SigLIP encoder combined with a Unified 3D-Resampler to efficiently encode high-frame-rate lip motion.

Analyzing how these interconnected systems simultaneously failed to protect public health requires innovative analytic approaches for exploring the vast amounts of data and documents disclosed in the UCSF-JHU Opioid Industry Documents Archive (OIDA). The complexity, multimodal nature, and specialized characteristics of these healthcare-related legal and corporate documents necessitate more advanced methods and models tailored to specific data types and detailed annotations, ensuring the precision and professionalism in the analysis. In this paper, we tackle this challenge by organizing the original dataset according to document attributes and constructing a benchmark with 400k training documents and 10k for testing. From each document, we extract rich multimodal information-including textual content, visual elements, and layout structures-to capture a comprehensive range of features. Using multiple AI models, we then generate a large-scale dataset comprising 360k training QA pairs and 10k testing QA pairs. Building on this foundation, we develop domain-specific multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore the impact of multimodal inputs on task performance. To further enhance response accuracy, we incorporate historical QA pairs as contextual grounding for answering current queries. Additionally, we incorporate page references within the answers and introduce an importance-based page classifier, further improving the precision and relevance of the information provided.

In this work, we present Norm-RAG, a retrieval-augmented, agentic framework for nuanced social norm inference in multi-turn dialogues. Norm-RAG models utterance-level attributes including communicative intent, speaker roles, interpersonal framing, and linguistic cues and grounds them in structured normative documentation retrieved via a novel Semantic Chunking approach. This enables interpretable and context-aware reasoning about norm adherence and violation across multilingual dialogues. We further introduce MINDS (Multilingual Interactions with Norm-Driven Speech), a bilingual dataset comprising 31 multi-turn Mandarin-English and Spanish-English conversations.

Hyperbolic space, characterized by its negative curvature, has demonstrated strong potential in such tasks due to its capacity to embed hierarchical structures with minimal distortion. Previous evidence indicates that the hyperbolic representation capacity can be further enhanced through kernel methods. However, existing hyperbolic kernels still suffer from mild geometric distortion or lack adaptability. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a curvature-aware de Branges-Rovnyak space, a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that is isometric to a Poincare ball.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising avenue for automating this process, prior research has been limited to small datasets and has been shown to produce superfluous, redundant KC labels. This study addresses these limitations by first scaling a \"simulated textbook\" LLM prompting strategy (using GPT-4o-mini) to a larger dataset of 646 multiple-choice questions. We found that this initial automated approach performed significantly worse than an expert-designed KC model (RMSE 0.4285 vs. 0.4206) and generated an excessive number of KCs (569 vs. 101). To address the issue of redundancy, we proposed and evaluated a novel method for merging semantically similar KC labels based on their cosine similarity. This merging strategy significantly improved the model's performance; a model using a cosine similarity threshold of 0.8 achieved the best result, reducing the KC count to 428 and improving the RMSE to 0.4259. This demonstrates that while scaled LLM generation alone is insufficient, combining it with a semantic merging technique offers a viable path toward automating and refining KC identification.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08KCs\uff09\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u6539\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u52a8\u8bc6\u522b\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff08KCs\uff09\u7684\u6548\u7387\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u6269\u5c55'\u6a21\u62df\u6559\u79d1\u4e66'LLM\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u81f3646\u4e2a\u591a\u9879\u9009\u62e9\u9898\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f59\u5f26\u76f8\u4f3c\u5ea6\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u4f59KCs\u3002", "result": "\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u9608\u503c0.8\u5c06KCs\u6570\u91cf\u964d\u81f3428\uff0cRMSE\u63d0\u5347\u81f30.4259\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5355\u7eaf\u6269\u5c55LLM\u751f\u6210\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4f46\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5408\u5e76\u6280\u672f\u53ef\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5e76\u4f18\u5316KCs\u8bc6\u522b\u3002"}}

However, existing methods for multi-hop reasoning tasks often lack global planning, increasing the risk of falling into local reasoning impasses. Insufficient exploitation of retrieved content and the neglect of latent clues fail to ensure the accuracy of reasoning outcomes. To overcome these limitations, we propose Recursive Evaluation and Adaptive Planning (REAP), whose core idea is to explicitly maintain structured sub-tasks and facts related to the current task through the Sub-task Planner (SP) and Fact Extractor (FE) modules. SP maintains a global perspective, guiding the overall reasoning direction and evaluating the task state based on the outcomes of FE, enabling dynamic optimization of the task-solving trajectory. FE performs fine-grained analysis over retrieved content to extract reliable answers and clues. These two modules incrementally enrich a logically coherent representation of global knowledge, enhancing the reliability and the traceability of the reasoning process. Furthermore, we propose a unified task paradigm design that enables effective multi-task fine-tuning, significantly enhancing SP's performance on complex, data-scarce tasks.

Existing methods often trigger retrieval based on low token-level confidence, which may lead to delayed intervention after errors have already propagated. We introduce Entropy-Trend Constraint (ETC), a training-free method that determines optimal retrieval timing by modeling the dynamics of token-level uncertainty. Specifically, ETC utilizes first- and second-order differences of the entropy sequence to detect emerging uncertainty trends, enabling earlier and more precise retrieval. Experiments on six QA benchmarks with three LLM backbones demonstrate that ETC consistently outperforms strong baselines while reducing retrieval frequency. ETC is particularly effective in domain-specific scenarios, exhibiting robust generalization capabilities.

However, when the retrieved evidence differs in language from the user query and in-context exemplars, the model often exhibits language drift by generating responses in an unintended language. This phenomenon is especially pronounced during reasoning-intensive decoding, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) generation, where intermediate steps introduce further language instability. In this paper, we systematically study output language drift in multilingual RAG across multiple datasets, languages, and LLM backbones. Our controlled experiments reveal that the drift results not from comprehension failure but from decoder-level collapse, where dominant token distributions and high-frequency English patterns dominate the intended generation language. We further observe that English serves as a semantic attractor under cross-lingual conditions, emerging as both the strongest interference source and the most frequent fallback language.\n  To mitigate this, we propose Soft Constrained Decoding (SCD), a lightweight, training-free decoding strategy that gently steers generation toward the target language by penalizing non-target-language tokens. SCD is model-agnostic and can be applied to any generation algorithm without modifying the architecture or requiring additional data.

However, most existing medical report generation (MRG) systems treat reports as flat sequences, overlooking this hierarchical organization and leading to inconsistencies between descriptive and diagnostic content. To align model behavior with real-world reporting practices, we propose RadFlow, a hierarchical workflow-guided reinforcement optimization framework that explicitly models the structured nature of clinical reporting. RadFlow introduces a clinically grounded reward hierarchy that mirrors the organization of radiological reports. At the global level, the reward integrates linguistic fluency, medical-domain correctness, and cross-sectional consistency between Finding and Impression, promoting coherent and clinically faithful narratives. At the local level, a section-specific reward emphasizes Impression quality, reflecting its central role in diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, a critical-aware policy optimization mechanism adaptively regularizes learning for high-risk or clinically sensitive cases, emulating the cautious refinement behavior of radiologists when documenting critical findings. Together, these components translate the structured reporting paradigm into the reinforcement fine-tuning process, enabling the model to generate reports that are both linguistically consistent and clinically aligned.

However, they continue to underperform in real-world medical scenarios, which often demand stronger context-awareness, i.e., the ability to recognize missing or critical details (e.g., user identity, medical history, risk factors) and provide safe, helpful, and contextually appropriate responses. To address this issue, we propose Multifaceted Self-Refinement (MuSeR), a data-driven approach that enhances LLMs' context-awareness along three key facets (decision-making, communication, and safety) through self-evaluation and refinement. Specifically, we first design a attribute-conditioned query generator that simulates diverse real-world user contexts by varying attributes such as role, geographic region, intent, and degree of information ambiguity. An LLM then responds to these queries, self-evaluates its answers along three key facets, and refines its responses to better align with the requirements of each facet. Finally, the queries and refined responses are used for supervised fine-tuning to reinforce the model's context-awareness ability. Evaluation results on the latest HealthBench dataset demonstrate that our method significantly improves LLM performance across multiple aspects, with particularly notable gains in the context-awareness axis. Furthermore, by incorporating knowledge distillation with the proposed method, the performance of a smaller backbone LLM (e.g., Qwen3-32B) surpasses its teacher model, achieving a new SOTA across all open-source LLMs on HealthBench (63.8%) and its hard subset (43.1%).

In this paper, we present the framework \"PustakAI\"\\footnote{Pustak means `book' in many Indian languages.} for the design and evaluation of a novel question-answering dataset \"NCERT-QA\" aligned with the NCERT curriculum for English and Science subjects of grades 6 to 8.

While efficient Transformer variants exist, they often require architectural changes and costly pre-training from scratch. To circumvent this, we propose ScaleFormer(Span Representation Cumulation for Long-Context Transformer) - a simple and effective plug-and-play framework that adapts off-the-shelf pre-trained encoder-decoder models to process long sequences without requiring architectural modifications. Our approach segments long inputs into overlapping chunks and generates a compressed, context-aware representation for the decoder. The core of our method is a novel, parameter-free fusion mechanism that endows each chunk's representation with structural awareness of its position within the document. It achieves this by enriching each chunk's boundary representations with cumulative context vectors from all preceding and succeeding chunks. This strategy provides the model with a strong signal of the document's narrative flow, achieves linear complexity, and enables pre-trained models to reason effectively over long-form text.

Such attacks exploit both intra-class and inter-class paths, progressively extracting fine-grained knowledge within topics and diffusing it across semantically related ones, thereby enabling comprehensive extraction of the original knowledge base. However, existing defenses target only one path, leaving the other unprotected. We conduct a systematic exploration to assess the impact of protecting each path independently and find that joint protection is essential for effective defense. Based on this, we propose RAGFort, a structure-aware dual-module defense combining \"contrastive reindexing\" for inter-class isolation and \"constrained cascade generation\" for intra-class protection.

Denoising has therefore become a critical preprocessing step, typically categorized into instance removal and instance correction techniques. However, existing correction approaches often degrade performance or oversimplify the problem by altering the original data distribution. This leads to unrealistic scenarios and biased models, which is particularly problematic in contexts where interpretable AI models are employed, as their interpretability depends on the fidelity of the underlying data patterns. In this paper, we argue that defining noise independently of the solution may be ineffective, as its nature can vary significantly across tasks and datasets. Using a task-specific high quality solution as a reference can provide a more precise and adaptable noise definition. To this end, we propose DenoGrad, a novel Gradient-based instance Denoiser framework that leverages gradients from an accurate Deep Learning (DL) model trained on the target data -- regardless of the specific task -- to detect and adjust noisy samples. Unlike conventional approaches, DenoGrad dynamically corrects noisy instances, preserving problem's data distribution, and improving AI models robustness. DenoGrad is validated on both tabular and time series datasets under various noise settings against the state-of-the-art.

A prominent approach to tackle such problems is to compile their constraints away, leading to a problem that is supported by state-of-the-art planners. Unfortunately, existing compilers do not scale on problems with a large number of objects and high-arity actions, as they necessitate grounding the problem before compilation. To address this issue, we propose two methods for compiling away constraints without grounding, making them suitable for large-scale planning problems. We prove the correctness of our compilers and outline their worst-case time complexity. Moreover, we present a reproducible empirical evaluation on the domains used in the latest International Planning Competition.

Experimental results are a core component of scientific work, often presented in varying formats such as tables or charts. Understanding how robust current multimodal large language models (multimodal LLMs) are at verifying scientific claims across different evidence formats remains an important and underexplored challenge. In this paper, we design and conduct a series of experiments to assess the ability of multimodal LLMs to verify scientific claims using both tables and charts as evidence. To enable this evaluation, we adapt two existing datasets of scientific papers by incorporating annotations and structures necessary for a multimodal claim verification task. Using this adapted dataset, we evaluate 12 multimodal LLMs and find that current models perform better with table-based evidence while struggling with chart-based evidence. We further conduct human evaluations and observe that humans maintain strong performance across both formats, unlike the models. Our analysis also reveals that smaller multimodal LLMs (under 8B) show weak correlation in performance between table-based and chart-based tasks, indicating limited cross-modal generalization. These findings highlight a critical gap in current models' multimodal reasoning capabilities.

Current strategies, however, often present a dilemma of suboptimal extremes: either separately train a small proxy model and then use it to shift the predictions of the foundation model, offering notable efficiency but often yielding limited improvement; or making API calls in each tuning iteration to the foundation model, which entails prohibitive computational costs. Therefore, we propose a novel advanced black-box tuning method for LLMs with limited API calls. Our core strategy involves training a Gaussian Process (GP) surrogate model with \"LogitMap Pairs\" derived from querying the foundation model on a minimal but highly informative training subset. This surrogate can approximate the outputs of the foundation model to guide the training of the proxy model, thereby effectively reducing the need for direct queries to the foundation model. Extensive experiments verify that our approach elevates pre-trained language model accuracy from 55.92% to 86.85%, reducing the frequency of API queries to merely 1.38%. This significantly outperforms offline approaches that operate entirely without API access. Notably, our method also achieves comparable or superior accuracy to query-intensive approaches, while significantly reducing API costs.

Most existing methods for traffic signal modeling often rely on the original data modality, i.e., numerical direct readings from the sensors in cities. However, this unimodal approach overlooks the semantic information existing in multimodal heterogeneous urban data in different perspectives, which hinders a comprehensive understanding of traffic signals and limits the accurate prediction of complex traffic dynamics. To address this problem, we propose a novel \\textit{M}ultimodal framework, \\textit{MTP}, for urban \\textit{T}raffic \\textit{P}rofiling, which learns multimodal features through numeric, visual, and textual perspectives. The three branches drive for a multimodal perspective of urban traffic signal learning in the frequency domain, while the frequency learning strategies delicately refine the information for extraction. Specifically, we first conduct the visual augmentation for the traffic signals, which transforms the original modality into frequency images and periodicity images for visual learning. Also, we augment descriptive texts for the traffic signals based on the specific topic, background information and item description for textual learning. To complement the numeric information, we utilize frequency multilayer perceptrons for learning on the original modality. We design a hierarchical contrastive learning on the three branches to fuse the spectrum of three modalities.

Nonetheless, existing neural solvers typically struggle to generalize effectively from synthetic, uniformly-distributed training data to real-world VRP scenarios, including widely recognized benchmark instances from TSPLib and CVRPLib. To bridge this generalization gap, we present Evolutionary Realistic Instance Synthesis (EvoReal), which leverages an evolutionary module guided by large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic instances characterized by diverse and realistic structural patterns. Specifically, the evolutionary module produces synthetic instances whose structural attributes statistically mimics those observed in authentic real-world instances. Subsequently, pre-trained NCO models are progressively refined, firstly aligning them with these structurally enriched synthetic distributions and then further adapting them through direct fine-tuning on actual benchmark instances. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that EvoReal markedly improves the generalization capabilities of state-of-the-art neural solvers, yielding a notable reduced performance gap compared to the optimal solutions on the TSPLib (1.05%) and CVRPLib (2.71%) benchmarks across a broad spectrum of problem scales.", "AI": {"tldr": "EvoReal\u5229\u7528\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u4e14\u771f\u5b9e\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u5b9e\u9645VRP\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u4ece\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754cVRP\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8fdb\u5316\u6a21\u5757\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\uff0c\u5e76\u9010\u6b65\u7cbe\u8c03\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684NCO\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793aEvoReal\u660e\u663e\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86\u4e0e\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "conclusion": "EvoReal\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u679c\u3002"}}

Recently, KG-enhanced LLMs that integrate knowledge graphs (KGs) have been shown to improve reasoning performance, particularly for complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, these methods still face significant challenges, including inaccurate retrieval and reasoning failures, often exacerbated by long input contexts that obscure relevant information or by context constructions that struggle to capture the richer logical directions required by different question types. Furthermore, many of these approaches rely on LLMs to directly retrieve evidence from KGs, and to self-assess the sufficiency of this evidence, which often results in premature or incorrect reasoning. To address the retrieval and reasoning failures, we propose ProgRAG, a multi-hop knowledge graph question answering (KGQA) framework that decomposes complex questions into sub-questions, and progressively extends partial reasoning paths by answering each sub-question. At each step, external retrievers gather candidate evidence, which is then refined through uncertainty-aware pruning by the LLM. Finally, the context for LLM reasoning is optimized by organizing and rearranging the partial reasoning paths obtained from the sub-question answers.

These methods typically rely on single-step Bellman updates, where the heuristic of a state is updated based on its best neighbor and the corresponding edge cost. This work proposes a generalized approach that enhances both state sampling and heuristic updates by performing limited-horizon searches and updating each state's heuristic based on the shortest path to the search frontier, incorporating both edge costs and the heuristic values of frontier states.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u91ce\u641c\u7d22\u548c\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u66f4\u65b0\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u72b6\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u641c\u7d22\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u5355\u6b65Bellman\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u91ce\u5185\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6267\u884c\u6709\u9650\u89c6\u91ce\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8fb9\u6210\u672c\u548c\u524d\u6cbf\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u503c\uff0c\u66f4\u65b0\u6bcf\u4e2a\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u641c\u7d22\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u72b6\u6001\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u89e3\u51b3\u6700\u77ed\u8def\u5f84\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Existing selection methods, often based on features like text quality, diversity, or task relevance, typically overlook the intrinsic linguistic structure of multilingual data. In this paper, we propose LangGPS, a lightweight two-stage pre-selection framework guided by language separability which quantifies how well samples in different languages can be distinguished in the model's representation space. LangGPS first filters training data based on separability scores and then refines the subset using existing selection methods. Extensive experiments across six benchmarks and 22 languages demonstrate that applying LangGPS on top of existing selection methods improves their effectiveness and generalizability in multilingual training, especially for understanding tasks and low-resource languages. Further analysis reveals that highly separable samples facilitate the formation of clearer language boundaries and support faster adaptation, while low-separability samples tend to function as bridges for cross-lingual alignment. Besides, we also find that language separability can serve as an effective signal for multilingual curriculum learning, where interleaving samples with diverse separability levels yields stable and generalizable gains. Together, we hope our work offers a new perspective on data utility in multilingual contexts and support the development of more linguistically informed LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faLangGPS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u6539\u8fdb\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5ffd\u7565\u6570\u636e\u7684\u8bed\u8a00\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLangGPS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u7b5b\u9009\u6570\u636e\uff1a\u5148\u57fa\u4e8e\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u518d\u7528\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cLangGPS\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u662f\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bed\u8a00\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u4e3a\u591a\u8bed\u8a00\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5177\u8bed\u8a00\u611f\u77e5\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

This delay primarily arises from the autoregressive generation of speech tokens and the reliance on complex flow-matching models for speech synthesis. To overcome this, we introduce VocalNet-M2, a novel low-latency SLM that integrates a multi-codebook tokenizer and a multi-token prediction (MTP) strategy. Our model directly generates multi-codebook speech tokens, thus eliminating the need for a latency-inducing flow-matching model. Furthermore, our MTP strategy enhances generation efficiency and improves overall performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VocalNet-M2 achieves a substantial reduction in first chunk latency (from approximately 725ms to 350ms) while maintaining competitive performance across mainstream SLMs. This work also provides a comprehensive comparison of single-codebook and multi-codebook strategies, offering valuable insights for developing efficient and high-performance SLMs for real-time interactive applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "VocalNet-M2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u578b\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u7801\u672c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e3b\u6d41\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u54cd\u5e94\u5ef6\u8fdf\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u8bed\u97f3\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u590d\u6742\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faVocalNet-M2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u591a\u7801\u672c\u5206\u8bcd\u5668\u548c\u591a\u4ee4\u724c\u9884\u6d4b\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u591a\u7801\u672c\u8bed\u97f3\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5ef6\u8fdf\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cVocalNet-M2\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u9996\u6b21\u5206\u5757\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08\u4ece\u7ea6725ms\u964d\u81f3350ms\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u4e0e\u4e3b\u6d41\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u4ea4\u4e92\u5e94\u7528\u8bed\u97f3\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9d\u8d35\u89c1\u89e3\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u591a\u7801\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, as adversaries increasingly imitate the style of authentic news, the effectiveness of such approaches is gradually diminishing. Recent research has explored incorporating large language models (LLMs) to enhance fake news detection. Yet, despite their transformative potential, LLMs remain an untapped goldmine for fake news detection, with their real-world adoption hampered by shallow functionality exploration, ambiguous usability, and prohibitive inference costs. In this paper, we propose a novel fake news detection framework, dubbed FactGuard, that leverages LLMs to extract event-centric content, thereby reducing the impact of writing style on detection performance. Furthermore, our approach introduces a dynamic usability mechanism that identifies contradictions and ambiguous cases in factual reasoning, adaptively incorporating LLM advice to improve decision reliability. To ensure efficiency and practical deployment, we employ knowledge distillation to derive FactGuard-D, enabling the framework to operate effectively in cold-start and resource-constrained scenarios.

Most existing methods rely on crafting high-quality supervised fine-tuning demonstrations for critiquing capability enhancement and pay little attention to delving into the underlying reason for the poor critiquing performance of LLMs. In this paper, we orthogonally quantify and investigate the potential reason -- imbalanced evaluation preference, and conduct a statistical preference analysis. Motivated by the analysis of the reason, a novel perplexity-aware reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to rectify the evaluation preference, elevating the critiquing capability. Specifically, to probe into LLMs' critiquing characteristics, a One-to-many Problem-Solution (OPS) benchmark is meticulously constructed to quantify the behavior difference of LLMs when evaluating the problem solutions generated by itself and others. Then, to investigate the behavior difference in depth, we conduct a statistical preference analysis oriented on perplexity and find an intriguing phenomenon -- ``LLMs incline to judge solutions with lower perplexity as correct'', which is dubbed as \\textit{imbalanced evaluation preference}. To rectify this preference, we regard perplexity as the baton in the algorithm of Group Relative Policy Optimization, supporting the LLMs to explore trajectories that judge lower perplexity as wrong and higher perplexity as correct.

This paper introduces ATR4CH (Adaptive Text-to-RDF for Cultural Heritage), a systematic five-step methodology for Large Language Model-based Knowledge Extraction from Cultural Heritage documents. We validate the methodology through a case study on authenticity assessment debates. Methodology - ATR4CH combines annotation models, ontological frameworks, and LLM-based extraction through iterative development: foundational analysis, annotation schema development, pipeline architecture, integration refinement, and comprehensive evaluation. We demonstrate the approach using Wikipedia articles about disputed items (documents, artifacts...), implementing a sequential pipeline with three LLMs (Claude Sonnet 3.7, Llama 3.3 70B, GPT-4o-mini). Findings - The methodology successfully extracts complex Cultural Heritage knowledge: 0.96-0.99 F1 for metadata extraction, 0.7-0.8 F1 for entity recognition, 0.65-0.75 F1 for hypothesis extraction, 0.95-0.97 for evidence extraction, and 0.62 G-EVAL for discourse representation. Smaller models performed competitively, enabling cost-effective deployment. Originality - This is the first systematic methodology for coordinating LLM-based extraction with Cultural Heritage ontologies.

As external knowledge repositories continue to expand and the parametric knowledge within models becomes outdated, a critical challenge for RAG systems is resolving conflicts between retrieved external information and LLMs' internal knowledge, which can significantly compromise the accuracy and reliability of generated content. However, existing approaches to conflict resolution typically operate at the token or semantic level, often leading to fragmented and partial understanding of factual discrepancies between LLMs' knowledge and context, particularly in knowledge-intensive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose TruthfulRAG, the first framework that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to resolve factual-level knowledge conflicts in RAG systems. Specifically, TruthfulRAG constructs KGs by systematically extracting triples from retrieved content, utilizes query-based graph retrieval to identify relevant knowledge, and employs entropy-based filtering mechanisms to precisely locate conflicting elements and mitigate factual inconsistencies, thereby enabling LLMs to generate faithful and accurate responses.

Formal frameworks for analogical inference have been developed for Boolean domains, where inference is provably sound for affine functions and approximately correct for functions close to affine. These results have informed the design of analogy-based classifiers. However, they do not extend to regression tasks or continuous domains. In this paper, we revisit analogical inference from a foundational perspective. We first present a counterexample showing that existing generalization bounds fail even in the Boolean setting. We then introduce a unified framework for analogical reasoning in real-valued domains based on parameterized analogies defined via generalized means. This model subsumes both Boolean classification and regression, and supports analogical inference over continuous functions. We characterize the class of analogy-preserving functions in this setting and derive both worst-case and average-case error bounds under smoothness assumptions.

A recently proposed method for this is to compute a sequence of explanation steps. Such a step-wise explanation shows individual reasoning steps involving constraints from the original specification, that in the end explain a conflict. However, computing a step-wise explanation is computationally expensive, limiting the scope of problems for which it can be used. We investigate how we can use proofs generated by a constraint solver as a starting point for computing step-wise explanations, instead of computing them step-by-step. More specifically, we define a framework of abstract proofs, in which both proofs and step-wise explanations can be represented. We then propose several methods for converting a proof to a step-wise explanation sequence, with special attention to trimming and simplification techniques to keep the sequence and its individual steps small.

The goal of this paper is to address these issues with two main contributions. The first contribution is DELICATE, a novel neuro-symbolic method for EL on historical Italian which combines a BERT-based encoder with contextual information from Wikidata to select appropriate KB entities using temporal plausibility and entity type consistency. The second contribution is ENEIDE, a multi-domain EL corpus in historical Italian semi-automatically extracted from two annotated editions spanning from the 19th to the 20th century and including literary and political texts. Results show how DELICATE outperforms other EL models in historical Italian even if compared with larger architectures with billions of parameters.

Each step consists of a set of constraints that derive an assignment to one or more decision variables. However, many candidate explanation steps exist, with different sets of constraints and different decisions they derive. To identify the most comprehensible one, a user-defined objective function is required to quantify the quality of each step. However, defining a good objective function is challenging. Here, interactive preference elicitation methods from the wider machine learning community can offer a way to learn user preferences from pairwise comparisons. We investigate the feasibility of this approach for step-wise explanations and address several limitations that distinguish it from elicitation for standard combinatorial problems. First, because the explanation quality is measured using multiple sub-objectives that can vary a lot in scale, we propose two dynamic normalization techniques to rescale these features and stabilize the learning process. We also observed that many generated comparisons involve similar explanations. For this reason, we introduce MACHOP (Multi-Armed CHOice Perceptron), a novel query generation strategy that integrates non-domination constraints with upper confidence bound-based diversification. We evaluate the elicitation techniques on Sudokus and Logic-Grid puzzles using artificial users, and validate them with a real-user evaluation.

These methods exhibit fundamental limitations when addressing knowledge-intensive tasks, as they operate within fixed parametric boundaries rather than providing the factual knowledge, terminology precision, and reasoning patterns required in specialized domains. To address these limitations, we propose Knowledge-Provision-based Prompt Optimization (KPPO), a framework that reformulates prompt optimization as systematic knowledge integration rather than potential elicitation. KPPO introduces three key innovations: 1) a knowledge gap filling mechanism for knowledge gap identification and targeted remediation; 2) a batch-wise candidate evaluation approach that considers both performance improvement and distributional stability; 3) an adaptive knowledge pruning strategy that balances performance and token efficiency, reducing up to 29% token usage. Extensive evaluation on 15 knowledge-intensive benchmarks from various domains demonstrates KPPO's superiority over elicitation-based methods, with an average performance improvement of ~6% over the strongest baseline while achieving comparable or lower token consumption.

In this work, we introduce AdvancedIF (we will release this benchmark soon), a comprehensive benchmark featuring over 1,600 prompts and expert-curated rubrics that assess LLMs ability to follow complex, multi-turn, and system-level instructions. We further propose RIFL (Rubric-based Instruction-Following Learning), a novel post-training pipeline that leverages rubric generation, a finetuned rubric verifier, and reward shaping to enable effective reinforcement learning for instruction following. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFL substantially improves the instruction-following abilities of LLMs, achieving a 6.7% absolute gain on AdvancedIF and strong results on public benchmarks. Our ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of each component in RIFL.

The main goal of RG is to be both computationally efficient and convenient for game design. The system consists of several languages. The core component is a low-level language that defines the rules by a finite automaton. It is minimal with only a few mechanisms, which makes it easy for automatic processing (by agents, analysis, optimization, etc.). The language is universal for the class of all finite turn-based games with imperfect information. Higher-level languages are introduced for game design (by humans or Procedural Content Generation), which are eventually translated to a low-level language. RG generates faster forward models than the current state of the art, beating other GGP systems (Regular Boardgames, Ludii) in terms of efficiency.

In this work, we systematically study how linguistic styles such as fear or curiosity can reframe harmful intent and elicit unsafe responses from aligned models. We construct style-augmented jailbreak benchmark by transforming prompts from 3 standard datasets into 11 distinct linguistic styles using handcrafted templates and LLM-based rewrites, while preserving semantic intent. Evaluating 16 open- and close-source instruction-tuned models, we find that stylistic reframing increases jailbreak success rates by up to +57 percentage points. Styles such as fearful, curious and compassionate are most effective and contextualized rewrites outperform templated variants.\n  To mitigate this, we introduce a style neutralization preprocessing step using a secondary LLM to strip manipulative stylistic cues from user inputs, significantly reducing jailbreak success rates.

While existing benchmarks have advanced the field, our work addresses fundamental challenges in statistical power, data generation consistency, and evaluation flexibility that limit current memory evaluation frameworks. We examine the relationship between conversational memory and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). While these systems share fundamental architectural patterns--temporal reasoning, implicit extraction, knowledge updates, and graph representations--memory systems have a unique characteristic: they start from zero and grow progressively with each conversation. This characteristic enables naive approaches that would be impractical for traditional RAG. Consistent with recent findings on long context effectiveness, we observe that simple full-context approaches achieve 70-82% accuracy even on our most challenging multi-message evidence cases, while sophisticated RAG-based memory systems like Mem0 achieve only 30-45% when operating on conversation histories under 150 interactions. Our analysis reveals practical transition points: long context excels for the first 30 conversations, remains viable with manageable trade-offs up to 150 conversations, and typically requires hybrid or RAG approaches beyond that point as costs and latencies become prohibitive. These patterns indicate that the small-corpus advantage of conversational memory--where exhaustive search and complete reranking are feasible--deserves dedicated research attention rather than simply applying general RAG solutions to conversation histories.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5305\u542b75,336\u4e2a\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u7684\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5e76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e0e\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff08RAG\uff09\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u590d\u6742RAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u51c6\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u529f\u6548\u3001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u7075\u6d3b\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u6837\u5316\u7c7b\u522b\u7684\u95ee\u7b54\u5bf9\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0eRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u7b80\u5355\u5168\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u65b9\u6cd5\u572830\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5185\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0870-82%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u800cRAG\u7cfb\u7edf\u8868\u73b0\u8f83\u5dee\uff0830-45%\uff09\u3002150\u6b21\u5bf9\u8bdd\u540e\u9700\u8f6c\u5411\u6df7\u5408\u6216RAG\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5bf9\u8bdd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u5f97\u4e13\u95e8\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u7b80\u5355\u5957\u7528RAG\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While more traditional perspectives on genre have emphasized form, contemporary scholarship has invoked both formal and institutional characteristics in its taxonomy of genre, genre fiction, and literary fiction. This project uses computational methods to explore the soundness of genre as a formal designation as opposed to an institutional one. Pulling from Andrew Piper's CONLIT dataset of Contemporary Literature, we assemble a corpus of literary and genre fiction, with the latter category containing romance, mystery, and science fiction novels. We use Welch's ANOVA to compare the distribution of narrative features according to author gender within each genre and within genre versus literary fiction. Then, we use logistic regression to model the effect that each feature has on literary classification and to measure how author gender moderates these effects. Finally, we analyze stylistic and semantic vector representations of our genre categories to understand the importance of form and content in literary classification.

Existing approaches primarily fall into two categories: token compression, which sacrifices fine-grained details; and introducing external retrievers, which increase system complexity and prevent end-to-end optimization. To address these issues, we conduct an in-depth analysis and observe that MLLMs exhibit a human-like coarse-to-fine reasoning pattern: early Transformer layers attend broadly across the document, while deeper layers focus on relevant evidence pages. Motivated by this insight, we posit that the inherent evidence localization capabilities of MLLMs can be explicitly leveraged to perform retrieval during the reasoning process, facilitating efficient long document understanding. To this end, we propose URaG, a simple-yet-effective framework that Unifies Retrieval and Generation within a single MLLM. URaG introduces a lightweight cross-modal retrieval module that converts the early Transformer layers into an efficient evidence selector, identifying and preserving the most relevant pages while discarding irrelevant content. This design enables the deeper layers to concentrate computational resources on pertinent information, improving both accuracy and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URaG achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing computational overhead by 44-56%.

While researchers have made progress using BERT and Graph Neural Networks, the full potential of advanced language models in understanding complex language patterns remains unexplored. We introduce DESS, a new approach that builds upon previous work by integrating DeBERTa's enhanced attention mechanism to better understand context and relationships in text. Our framework maintains a dual-channel structure, where DeBERTa works alongside an LSTM channel to process both meaning and grammatical patterns in text. We have carefully refined how these components work together, paying special attention to how different types of language information interact. When we tested DESS on standard datasets, it showed meaningful improvements over current methods, with F1-score increases of 4.85, 8.36, and 2.42 in identifying aspect opinion pairs and determining sentiment accurately. Looking deeper into the results, we found that DeBERTa's sophisticated attention system helps DESS handle complicated sentence structures better, especially when important words are far apart. Our findings suggest that upgrading to more advanced language models when thoughtfully integrated, can lead to real improvements in how well we can analyze sentiments in text.

The MEDIQA-WV 2025 shared task addresses this challenge by focusing on generating free-text responses to wound care queries paired with images. In this work, we present two complementary approaches developed for the English track. The first leverages a mined prompting strategy, where training data is embedded and the top-k most similar examples are retrieved to serve as few-shot demonstrations during generation. The second approach builds on a metadata ablation study, which identified four metadata attributes that consistently enhance response quality. We train classifiers to predict these attributes for test cases and incorporate them into the generation pipeline, dynamically adjusting outputs based on prediction confidence. Experimental results demonstrate that mined prompting improves response relevance, while metadata-guided generation further refines clinical precision. Together, these methods highlight promising directions for developing AI-driven tools that can provide reliable and efficient wound care support.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5904\u7406\u4f24\u53e3\u62a4\u7406\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u7684\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53e6\u4e00\u79cd\u662f\u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5316\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f02\u6b65\u8fdc\u7a0b\u62a4\u7406\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u53d1\u5c55\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u533b\u62a4\u4eba\u5458\u8d1f\u62c5\uff0c\u9700\u8981AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u5347\u7ba1\u7406\u60a3\u8005\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u5d4c\u5165\u68c0\u7d22\u76f8\u4f3c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2. \u901a\u8fc7\u5143\u6570\u636e\u9884\u6d4b\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u751f\u6210\u5185\u5bb9\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u663e\u793a\uff0c\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u63d0\u793a\u63d0\u5347\u56de\u7b54\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u5143\u6570\u636e\u6307\u5bfc\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u4f18\u5316\u4e34\u5e8a\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u5408\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u9760\u7684AI\u4f24\u53e3\u62a4\u7406\u5de5\u5177\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}
