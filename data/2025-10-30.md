### [1] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-ACM模型通过结合运动感知解码提升视频字幕质量，利用人体网格恢复的运动表示，减少幻觉，提升语义和空间对齐效果，并在HMI数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕模型难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致字幕模糊或语义不一致。

Method: 提出M-ACM框架，结合人体网格恢复的运动表示，通过运动感知解码生成高质量字幕。开发了HMI数据集和HMI-Bench基准。

Result: M-ACM在描述复杂人体运动和细微时间变化方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M-ACM为运动中心化视频字幕任务设立了新标准。

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [2] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究如何通过合成SAR图像训练深度学习模型进行自动目标识别(ATR)，并提出了结合两种不同模拟器生成数据集的方法以提高模型泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实标记SAR数据缺乏的问题，并通过合成数据生成多样化数据集。同时，分析了模拟数据与现实数据的差异对ATR模型的影响。

Method: 使用两种不同的SAR模拟器(MOCEM和Salsa)生成合成数据集，结合深度学习模型ADASCA进行训练。

Result: 在MSTAR测量数据上达到了接近88%的准确率。

Conclusion: 结合不同模拟器生成的方法可以有效提升ATR模型在真实SAR数据上的泛化性能。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [3] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于机器学习的MLS点云不确定性评估框架，通过局部几何特征预测点级误差，避免了依赖高精度参考数据的传统方法，扩展性强且适应性高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的不确定性建模依赖于高精度参考数据，成本高且难以大规模获取，因此需要一种数据驱动的方法来评估MLS点云的不确定性。

Method: 使用随机森林（RF）和XGBoost两种集成学习模型，通过局部几何特征预测点级误差，并在空间分区数据集上训练验证以避免数据泄漏。

Result: 实验结果显示，两种模型均能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性之间的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87，其中高程变化、点密度和局部结构复杂度是关键特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模点云的质量控制和误差分析提供了一种可扩展且适应性强的数据驱动方法。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [4] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种多模态交叉增强融合框架，结合眼动追踪和面部特征来辅助阿尔茨海默病的诊断，通过交叉注意力模块和方向感知卷积模块提升诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的准确诊断对及时干预和延缓病情发展至关重要，但现有研究很少结合眼动追踪和面部特征进行多模态辅助诊断。

Method: 研究提出了多模态交叉增强融合框架，包括交叉增强融合注意力模块（CEFAM）和方向感知卷积模块（DACM），用于建模模态间交互和细粒度面部特征。

Result: 在一个包含25名AD患者和25名健康对照的数据集上，该方法实现了95.11%的分类准确率，优于传统融合方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式建模模态间依赖关系和模态特异性贡献，展示了更高的鲁棒性和诊断性能。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [6] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ESCA框架，通过高效的后训练量化和定制硬件加速器，优化资源受限VR设备上的Codec Avatars实时推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Photorealistic Codec Avatars模型在VR设备上运行时计算需求高，难以实现低延迟和高能效的实时推理。

Method: 提出了高效的后训练量化（PTQ）方法和定制硬件加速器，并结合为全栈优化框架ESCA。

Result: ESCA在4-bit精度下FovVideoVDP质量提升+0.39，延迟降低3.36倍，渲染速度达100帧/秒，满足实时VR需求。

Conclusion: 证明了在资源受限设备上部署高保真Codec Avatars的可行性，为更沉浸和便携的VR体验铺平道路。

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [7] [PISA-Bench: The PISA Index as a Multilingual and Multimodal Metric for the Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24792)
*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了PISA-Bench，一个基于专家设计的PISA测试的多语言视觉-语言基准，填补了高质量多模态数据集的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉-语言模型的基准缺乏高质量、人工验证的多语言数据，且依赖合成内容，PISA-Bench旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 从PISA测试中提取人类编写的指令、问题、选项和图像，并将其翻译为六种语言，构建完全平行的语料库。

Result: 评估发现小型模型表现不佳，非英语部分性能显著下降，空间和几何推理错误率高。

Conclusion: 发布PISA-Bench数据集和评估框架，为多语言多模态推理研究提供资源。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

### [8] [A Survey on Efficient Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24795)
*Zhaoshu Yu,Bo Wang,Pengpeng Zeng,Haonan Zhang,Ji Zhang,Lianli Gao,Jingkuan Song,Nicu Sebe,Heng Tao Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文综述了高效Vision-Language-Action模型（Efficient VLAs）的研究进展，解决其计算和数据需求大的问题，提出了统一的分类框架并总结了代表性应用和未来研究方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision-Language-Action模型（VLAs）在具身智能领域具有潜力，但其大规模计算和数据需求阻碍了实际部署。本文旨在解决这些挑战。

Method: 提出了一个统一的分类框架，将现有技术分为三大支柱：高效模型设计、高效训练和高效数据收集，并深入分析了每种方法。

Result: 综述了目前最先进的方法，总结了代表性应用、关键挑战，并提出了未来研究的路线图。

Conclusion: 高效VLAs的研究是解决VLAs部署瓶颈的关键，未来需要通过跨领域合作和技术创新进一步优化。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [9] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了视觉语言模型的冲突适应行为，发现其与人类认知控制相似，并通过稀疏自编码器揭示了任务的神经表征基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索视觉语言模型是否表现出类似人类认知控制的冲突适应行为，并理解其背后的表征机制。

Method: 使用顺序Stroop任务测试13个视觉语言模型，并用稀疏自编码器分析InternVL 3.5 4B模型的超级节点。

Result: 12个模型表现出冲突适应行为；超级节点的分布反映了人类阅读和颜色命中的不对称性；特定超级节点的消融显著增加了Stroop错误。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型的行为和神经表征与人类认知控制相似，支持其对冲突的动态响应能力。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [10] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DualCap的新方法，通过从检索到的相似图像生成视觉提示来丰富视觉表示，解决了现有轻量级检索增强图像字幕模型中视觉特征未被充分利用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的轻量级检索增强图像字幕模型通常仅将检索到的数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征（尤其是对象细节或复杂场景）未被充分增强，存在语义差距。

Method: DualCap采用双检索机制，结合标准的图像到文本检索和新型的图像到图像检索来获取视觉相似的场景，从中提取关键词语并与原始图像特征融合。

Result: 实验表明，DualCap在性能上具有竞争力，且与先前的视觉提示字幕方法相比需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualCap通过视觉提示的设计有效提升了图像字幕的质量，同时保持了模型轻量化的优势。

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过三阶段框架结合深度学习与传统机器学习，显著提高了鱼类新鲜度视觉评估的准确性和特征透明度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼类新鲜度评估对食品安全和经济至关重要，但传统方法主观且耗时，现有深度学习方法存在准确性和特征透明度问题。

Method: 研究采用三阶段方法：1)微调五种视觉架构；2)提取多级特征训练七种经典分类器；3)用LGBM等方法选择最佳特征子集。

Result: 在FFE数据集上，最佳配置达到85.99%准确率，比其他研究高8.69-22.78%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅高效且具通用性，适用于视觉质量评估任务。

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频假新闻检测基准通常只关注最终决策的准确性，缺乏对整个检测过程的细粒度评估，使得检测过程成为“黑箱”。因此，研究引入了MVFNDB基准，以填补这一空白。

Method: 基于实证分析构建MVFNDB基准，设计MVFND-CoT框架，结合创造者添加内容和原始拍摄素材推理，并通过基准任务验证多模态特征对结果的影响。

Result: MVFNDB基准包含10个任务和9730个人工标注问题，MVFND-CoT框架验证了多模态特征结合对检测结果的重要性，并分析了影响准确性的深层次因素。

Conclusion: MVFNDB基准为未来MLLMs在视频假新闻检测领域的评估和进步奠定了基础。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种多轮安全编辑框架MR-SafeEdit，通过SafeEditor工具实现文本到图像生成的安全对齐，解决了现有方法的过度拒绝和安全效用失衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为改善文本到图像（T2I）模型的安全性问题，特别是推理时方法的过度拒绝和安全效用失衡问题，需要一种高效且通用的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一个模型无关的即插即用框架MR-SafeEdit，并构建了多轮图文交错的数据集。同时开发了SafeEditor，一个能多轮编辑生成图像的统一MLLM。

Result: 实验表明，SafeEditor优于现有方法，减少了过度拒绝，同时实现了更好的安全效用平衡。

Conclusion: 该框架为T2I模型的安全对齐提供了一种高效的通用解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

Abstract: We propose Ming-Flash-Omni, an upgraded version of Ming-Omni, built upon a
sparser Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) variant of Ling-Flash-2.0 with 100 billion
total parameters, of which only 6.1 billion are active per token. This
architecture enables highly efficient scaling (dramatically improving
computational efficiency while significantly expanding model capacity) and
empowers stronger unified multimodal intelligence across vision, speech, and

a capability that not only achieves strong standalone segmentation performance
but also enhances spatial control in image generation and improves editing
consistency. Notably, Ming-Flash-Omni achieves state-of-the-art results in
text-to-image generation and generative segmentation, and sets new records on
all 12 contextual ASR benchmarks, all within a single unified architecture.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解流匹配生成过程中影响生成质量的因素。

Method: 采用去噪视角，设计框架实证研究生成过程，并通过扰动（噪声和漂移）影响样本生成。

Result: 揭示了生成过程的动态阶段，明确了去噪器在生成过程中的成功与失败阶段及其原因。

Conclusion: 该研究为流匹配模型的生成过程提供了新的见解，有助于优化生成质量。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种连续的概率学习方法，用于水果和蔬菜成熟度估计，通过改进RT-DETRv2模型，引入概率头部，预测成熟度分布的均值和不确定性，优于传统离散分类方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法将成熟度视为离散分类问题，忽视了其连续生物学特性，导致信息丢失和模糊的类别边界。本文旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 提出对RT-DETRv2模型的改进，新增概率头部，使其能够预测成熟度的连续分布及其不确定性。

Result: 模型在大型水果数据集上实现了85.6%的mAP，提供了比离散分类方法更细粒度和准确的成熟度评估。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅保留了卓越的检测性能，还为现代农业中的智能自动化系统提供了不确定性感知能力。

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Motivation: 针对现有基于OpenPose的关键点检测方法在处理速度上的不足，探索轻量级MediaPipe的使用，并通过关键点子集选择和插值技术提升性能。

Method: 采用MediaPipe提取关键点，研究了关键点子集选择策略，并引入样条插值技术处理缺失关键点问题。

Conclusion: 通过关键点子集选择和简单插值技术，实现了高效且准确的手势识别，为可扩展的手语识别系统提供了基础。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Result: 该方法计算高效且对基础设施要求低，适合实际场景部署。

Conclusion: 提出的车辆检测方法为优化交通流量提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型在处理非常规摄像机运动时表现不佳，原因是难以获取足够训练数据。

Method: 利用合成视频数据，采用解耦策略分离摄像机运动学习和外观伪影，确保鲁棒的运动表示。

Result: VividCam能够合成精确控制的复杂摄像机运动，且仅需简单的合成数据（如低多边形3D场景）。

Conclusion: VividCam为解决非常规摄像机运动生成问题提供了高效方法，显著减少了对真实视频的依赖。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Result: 研究发现DUSt3R的对应关系估计在几何重建中得到了细化。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了DUSt3R模型的行为差异，并提供了改进方向和使用建议。

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

TL;DR: M-SAM是一种多模态学习框架，通过识别主导模态、调整损失景观和更新权重，提升模型鲁棒性和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多模态学习中，主导模态常掩盖其他模态，影响泛化能力。M-SAM旨在平衡模态贡献，提升整体性能。

Method: M-SAM通过三步优化学习：1）基于Shapley识别主导模态；2）调制损失景观以增强主导模态鲁棒性；3）反向传播调制梯度更新权重。

Result: 在四个数据集上的实验表明，M-SAM优于最新优化和梯度操纵方法，显著平衡并提升了多模态学习性能。

Conclusion: M-SAM通过模态感知和损失调制，有效提升了多模态学习的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Motivation: Wi-Fi感知因其低成本、非侵入式的特点在医疗、空间占用分析和基于手势的物联网控制等领域有广泛应用潜力，但过拟合问题限制了其模型的泛化能力。

Method: 提出了一种名为IBIS的混合架构，结合Inception-BiLSTM和SVM，旨在提升模型泛化能力和分类边界鲁棒性。

Result: 在多普勒数据上，IBIS实现了接近99%的运动识别准确率，并通过全面的性能指标和混淆矩阵验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: IBIS通过创新的混合架构显著提高了Wi-Fi感知模型的泛化能力和分类性能，为相关应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 压力溃疡分期的准确性和一致性对治疗至关重要，但现有AI方法在可解释性和实时性上存在不足。

Method: 采用FT-ARM模型，结合微调和自反思机制，通过多模态输入迭代优化预测结果。

Conclusion: FT-ARM通过提升准确性和可解释性，有效支持临床决策，推动了自动化伤口评估系统的实用化。

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Result: 在ImageNet从头训练和CLIP对比预训练中，DRIP显著减少了GFLOP，同时保持了分类和零样本性能。

Conclusion: DRIP方法在高效计算和性能之间取得了平衡，并在生物学数据集上验证了其扩展能力。

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Result: 在HICO-DET基准测试中，VDRP在四种零样本评估设置下均取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: VDRP有效解决了类内多样性和类间视觉纠缠，为交互检测提供了新思路。

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

*Qingdong Cai,Charith Abhayaratne*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了Region-CAM方法，通过提取语义信息图和语义信息传播，改进传统CAM方法在弱监督学习任务中的性能，特别是在弱监督语义分割和目标定位任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法只能突出目标中最具判别性的区域，导致覆盖范围不全且边界对齐不准确，限制了弱监督学习任务的性能。

Method: Region-CAM通过提取语义信息图（SIMs）并进行语义信息传播（SIP），结合梯度和特征信息，生成更全面的激活图，边界更精确。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和MS COCO数据集上，Region-CAM的平均交并比（mIoU）显著优于传统CAM方法；在目标定位任务中，定位精度Top-1 Loc1达到51.7%。

Conclusion: Region-CAM在弱监督语义分割和目标定位任务中表现优越，显著提升了激活图的覆盖范围和边界精度。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Motivation: 生成式AI的兴起使得检测AI生成图像成为确保真实性的关键挑战，现有方法缺乏理论基础且依赖经验启发式，限制了方法的解释性和可靠性。

Method: 提出Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound理论，并通过动态重建误差方法ReGap，利用结构化编辑操作引入可控扰动，测量编辑前后的误差变化。

Conclusion: ReGap方法在检测AI生成图像方面表现出更高的准确性和鲁棒性，解决了现有方法的局限性，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Motivation: 现有液体薄膜厚度测量技术在临床转化中因相位周期性、噪声和计算复杂度等挑战受限，亟需高效的自动化解决方案。

Method: 采用视觉Transformer模型，结合合成与实验数据训练，利用长程空间相关性解决相位模糊问题，单次前向传播完成厚度重建。

Conclusion: 该方法为液体薄膜厚度的实时监测和干眼症等疾病的非侵入式诊断提供了新可能。

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Result: 在单条件和多条件约束生成任务中，TGBFN表现优异，生成高保真、条件感知的CAD序列。

Conclusion: TGBFN在多模态CAD生成领域取得了先进成果。

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

Conclusion: 提出的$D^2GS$框架实现了无需LiDAR的高精度城市场景重建，解决了LiDAR数据获取的困难，并通过深度增强和几何约束进一步提升了重建效果。

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

Conclusion: 该方法突破了传统限制，展现了在复杂实际场景中的强大适应能力。

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

paper presents a multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) diagnostic framework
integrating image analysis, thermal imaging, and audio signal processing for
early detection of three major health conditions: skin cancer, vascular blood

convolutional neural network was trained on the ISIC 2019 dataset for skin

specificity. A support vector machine (SVM) with handcrafted features was
employed for thermal clot detection, achieving 86.4% accuracy (AUC = 0.89) on
synthetic and clinical data. For cardiopulmonary analysis, lung and heart sound
datasets from PhysioNet and Pascal were processed using Mel-Frequency Cepstral
Coefficients (MFCC) and classified via Random Forest, reaching 87.2% accuracy
and 85.7% sensitivity. Comparative evaluation against state-of-the-art models
demonstrates that the proposed system achieves competitive results while
remaining lightweight and deployable on low-cost devices. The framework
provides a promising step toward scalable, real-time, and accessible AI-based

Conclusion: U-CAN不仅在3D领域表现出色，其方法也适用于2D图像去噪，为无监督去噪提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过优化特征提取和融合，提升了光度立体技术的性能，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Conclusion: 研究表明，渐进式适应和去噪监督对域偏移下的稳健分割至关重要。

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Rectified flow虽能高效生成高质量图像，但仍存在对大量生成数据依赖和性能偏倚的问题。为解决这些问题，作者探索了将真实图像融入训练的新方法。

Method: 提出了一种新方法，在训练过程中保留真实图像的ODE路径，从而减少对生成数据的依赖，并通过更小的生成与真实图像集高效进行reflow过程。

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，新方法在一步生成和全步模拟中获得了更好的FID分数，同时仅需原始方法的部分生成数据。

Conclusion: 新方法不仅提升了生成质量和计算效率，还避免了reflow过程中的饱和问题，使ODE学习更稳健且能更好地保留真实图像分布。

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Conclusion: 该研究为情感驱动的3D面部动画提供了有效解决方案，未来可进一步扩展数据集和应用场景。

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose

Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate

TL;DR: DeepShield是一种新型深度伪造检测框架，通过局部补丁引导和全局伪造多样化增强CLIP-ViT编码器，显著提升跨数据集和跨操作的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于现有检测器对伪造特定伪影的依赖，其在多样化伪造技术中的泛化能力不足，DeepShield旨在解决这一问题。

Method: DeepShield结合局部补丁引导（LPG）进行精细化不一致性建模，并通过全局伪造多样化（GFD）增强域适应性。

Result: 在跨数据集和跨操作评估中，DeepShield优于现有方法，对未见深度伪造攻击表现出更强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DeepShield通过新颖的局部和全局分析实现了跨域深度伪造检测的显著改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Motivation: 针对现有研究中树木分类方法的不足，探讨深度学习在提升分类准确性和适应性方面的潜力。

Method: 使用高分辨率航空影像和新生成的数据集，比较了六种语义分割架构（如CNN和Transformer混合模型）的性能。

Result: 模型整体表现良好，FT-UNetFormer表现最佳，但对复杂结构的分类仍具挑战性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了区域多样性训练数据的重要性，并提供了公开可用的数据集和代码。

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Conclusion: 通过语言基础和MLLM驱动的部分查询优化策略，验证了方法的有效性，代码将公开。

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为DPTM的新框架，通过生成伪目标域来解决源自由域自适应问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 源自由域自适应（SFDA）任务面临域差异大的挑战，现有的生成和非生成方法均有局限性。

Method: 利用目标数据生成伪目标域，分为信任集和非信任集，并通过潜在扩散模型逐步优化域差异。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上表现优异，特别是在域差异大的情况下性能提升高达18.6%。

Conclusion: DPTM框架显著优于现有方法，为解决SFDA问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本目标检测（FSOD）在仅有少量新类样本时，存在基类偏差和校准不稳定的问题。为了解决这一问题，提出了PDA方法。

Method: PDA采用原型驱动的对齐方法，通过维护支持原型、原型条件RoI对齐、EMA更新原型以及最佳K匹配方案，结合度量相似性与检测器logits。

Result: 在VOC FSOD和GFSOD基准测试中，PDA显著提升了新类性能，对基类影响极小，计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: PDA是一种高效且轻量的解决方案，显著提升了少样本目标检测中的新类性能。

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决边缘设备上实时多模态推理中传感动态与模型执行紧密耦合以及复杂模态间依赖的问题。

Result: 在公开数据集和真实无人机平台上验证，MMEdge显著降低了端到端延迟同时保持任务准确性。

Conclusion: MMEdge为资源有限的边缘设备提供了一种高效的多模态推理解决方案，具备广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be
accessed at https://github.com/Fleeting-hyh/StreamingCoT.

Motivation: 现有的自动音频描述方法通常独立生成每个描述，导致内容重复且不连贯。

Method: CoherentAD方法通过生成多个候选描述并进行自回归选择，形成连贯的叙事。

Result: 该方法生成的音频描述序列更具连贯性和信息量，优于独立生成的方法。

Conclusion: CoherentAD提升了音频描述的叙事连贯性，并通过新指标验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提高了半监督3D动作识别的效率和性能。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Motivation: 解决冠状动脉钙化评分（CAC）中标注数据不足的问题，探索非对比冠状动脉CT血管造影（CCTA）扫描的自动化方法。

Method: 使用伪标记生成训练标签，结合放射组学和预训练基础模型（CT-FM和RadImageNet）提取特征，并与传统分类器结合。

Result: 在182名患者的临床数据集中，放射组学模型显著优于基于CNN的基础模型（准确率达84%，p<0.05）。

Conclusion: 放射组学方法在缺乏专家标注的情况下仍能有效提升冠状动脉钙化检测的准确性，为临床提供了一种可行的替代方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的全局提示调优在异构客户端上泛化能力不足，而个性化调优则容易过拟合本地数据。为了解决这一问题，本文旨在设计一种既能实现泛化又能个性化的联邦提示调优框架。

Method: 提出了PEP-FedPT框架，引入CCMP机制，该机制基于类别特定提示和全局共享提示，结合全局类别原型和客户端类别先验权重自适应地生成个性化提示。优化过程通过联邦平均技术实现。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet、DomainNet和iNaturalist数据集上的实验结果表明，PEP-FedPT在异构数据场景下显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT为ViTs的高效且可泛化的联邦提示调优提供了强大支持，解决了泛化与个性化之间的平衡问题。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

Method: 提出新数据集i-CIR，采用半自动选择困难负样本的方法；开发训练无关的方法BASIC，利用预训练的视觉-语言模型分别计算相似度并进行后期融合。

Result: BASIC在i-CIR和现有语义级定义的数据集上均取得了最新成果。

Conclusion: i-CIR数据集和BASIC方法为CIR领域的进一步研究提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The progress of composed image retrieval (CIR), a popular research direction
in image retrieval, where a combined visual and textual query is used, is held
back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

Conclusion: SPADE有望支持实际水下检查和干预任务，相关工作已提交至IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering特刊。

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE

### [58] [RegionE: Adaptive Region-Aware Generation for Efficient Image Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25590)
*Pengtao Chen,Xianfang Zeng,Maosen Zhao,Mingzhu Shen,Peng Ye,Bangyin Xiang,Zhibo Wang,Wei Cheng,Gang Yu,Tao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE是一个自适应的、区域感知的图像编辑框架，通过区分图像中需要编辑和不需要编辑的区域，显著加速了基于指令的图像编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的图像编辑模型对整个图像采用统一的生成过程，忽略了不同区域的生成难度和计算冗余差异，导致效率低下。

Method: RegionE框架包括自适应区域划分、区域感知生成和自适应速度衰减缓存三部分，分别用于识别未编辑区域、加速未编辑区域的去噪过程以及优化局部去噪效率。

Result: RegionE在多款先进图像编辑模型中实现了2.06至2.57倍的加速，同时保持了语义和感知保真度。

Conclusion: RegionE通过区域感知的生成策略，有效提升了图像编辑的效率和质量，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

*Zhi-Kai Chen,Jun-Peng Jiang,Han-Jia Ye,De-Chuan Zhan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Hawk是一种利用图像空间结构优化自回归图像生成模型的新方法，显著提升了推理速度，同时保持了图像质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型虽然能生成高保真图像，但其逐令牌的解码过程导致推理速度慢。Speculative decoding在文本生成中已证明有效，但在图像生成中的应用尚未充分探索，主要由于采样空间大和空间结构利用不足。

Method: 研究人员提出了Hawk方法，通过利用图像的空间结构，引导推测模型做出更准确和高效的预测。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，Hawk实现了1.71倍的推理加速，同时保持了图像的保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: Hawk成功解决了自回归图像生成模型的效率问题，为图像生成领域提供了一种高效且高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated
information about this survey, codes and implementation of the open benchmarks

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeArt3D是一种无需训练的框架，用于生成高质量的3D铰接对象，通过利用预训练的静态3D扩散模型和扩展的Score Distillation Sampling方法，实现了高效的几何、纹理和铰接参数优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 铰接3D对象在机器人、AR/VR和动画等领域有广泛应用，但现有方法要么需要密集视角监督，要么生成结果粗糙且忽略表面纹理。FreeArt3D旨在克服这些限制，提供高效的解决方案。

Method: FreeArt3D利用预训练的静态3D扩散模型作为形状先验，将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域，将铰接作为额外的生成维度，通过联合优化几何、纹理和铰接参数实现生成。

Result: 该方法生成高保真几何和纹理，准确预测底层运动结构，并在多样化的对象类别中表现良好，不仅在质量上优于现有方法，还显著提升了处理速度。

Conclusion: FreeArt3D通过无需训练的优化框架，成功实现了高质量铰接3D对象的生成，展示了其在跨类别通用性和效率上的显著优势。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

TL;DR: VFXMaster是一个统一的、基于参考的VFX视频生成框架，通过上下文学习任务实现多样化动态效果的生成，并在未知效果类别上表现出显著的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成AI方法在视觉特效（VFX）创建中面临资源密集和泛化能力不足的问题，限制了其扩展性和创造性。

Method: VFXMaster采用基于参考的上下文学习策略，设计了上下文注意力掩码和解耦注入关键效果属性的机制，并提出高效的一次性效果适应机制。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效模仿多样化的效果类别，并在域外效果上表现出卓越的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VFXMaster为生成AI的VFX创作提供了一种高效、统一的解决方案，将推动未来研究和应用的发展。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM生成的复杂计划常缺乏时间和空间一致性，尤其在涉及物理旅行限制的场景，研究旨在评估和改进LLM生成旅行行程的时间表现。

Method: 利用先进LLM生成旅行计划，并通过AeroDataBox API验证这些计划是否符合现实航班时间限制。

Result: 实验表明，当前LLM常生成时间不一致的行程，但通过提出的框架可系统性纠正，使LLM在大规模旅行规划中实际部署成为可能。

Conclusion: 研究为LLM处理复杂时间推理任务提供了理解框架，并通过验证工具提升了LLM生成旅行行程的实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has enabled them to
generate complex, multi-step plans and itineraries. However, these generated
plans often lack temporal and spatial consistency, particularly in scenarios
involving physical travel constraints. This research aims to study the temporal
performance of different LLMs and presents a validation framework that
evaluates and improves the temporal consistency of LLM-generated travel
itineraries. The system employs multiple state-of-the-art LLMs to generate
travel plans and validates them against real-world flight duration constraints
using the AeroDataBox API. This work contributes to the understanding of LLM
capabilities in handling complex temporal reasoning tasks like itinerary
generation and provides a framework to rectify any temporal inconsistencies
like overlapping journeys or unrealistic transit times in the itineraries
generated by LLMs before the itinerary is given to the user. Our experiments
reveal that while current LLMs frequently produce temporally inconsistent
itineraries, these can be systematically and reliably corrected using our
framework, enabling their practical deployment in large-scale travel planning.

TL;DR: Falcon是一个跨领域的中文文本转SQL基准测试工具，基于企业兼容的MaxCompute/Hive方言，包含600个中文问题和28个数据库，重点评估中文语义和企业SQL特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为填补中文文本转SQL领域的空白，尤其是针对企业环境中复杂数据库和多表推理的需求。

Method: 构建了一个包含600个中文问题和28个数据库的基准测试，标注SQL计算特征和中文语义，并提供了执行比较器和自动化评估流程。

Result: 当前最先进的大规模模型（包括Deepseek）的最高准确率仅为50%，主要错误源于企业环境中复杂的模式链接和中文语义映射。

Conclusion: Falcon通过提供企业级模式、查询模板和执行验证工具，为中文文本转SQL技术提供了可靠的测试和验证平台。

Abstract: We introduce Falcon, a cross-domain Chinese text-to-SQL benchmark grounded in
an enterprise-compatible dialect (MaxCompute/Hive). It contains 600 Chinese
questions over 28 databases; 77% require multi-table reasoning and over half
touch more than four tables. Each example is annotated along SQL-computation
features and Chinese semantics. For evaluation, we release a robust execution
comparator and an automated evaluation pipeline, under which all current
state-of-the-art large-scale models (including Deepseek) achieve accuracies of
at most 50%. Major errors originate from two sources: (1) schema linking in
large enterprise landscapes - hundreds of tables, denormalized fields,
ambiguous column names, implicit foreign-key relations and domain-specific
synonyms that make correct join/column selection difficult; and (2) mapping
concise, colloquial Chinese into the exact operators and predicates required
for analytics - e.g., choosing the correct aggregation and group-by keys,
expressing time windows and granularities, applying unit conversions, handling
NULLs and data-quality rules, and formulating nested or windowed subqueries.
Falcon therefore targets Chinese-specific semantics and enterprise dialects
(abbreviations, business jargon, fuzzy entity references) and provides a
reproducible middle ground before full production deployment by using realistic
enterprise schemas, query templates, an execution comparator, and an automated
evaluation pipeline for end-to-end validation.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文通过分析大型语言模型（LLM）内部状态的几何差异，揭示了模型自信与实际问题解决能力间的脱节。研究发现，评估阶段和执行阶段的几何复杂性差异是主要原因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究LLM中自信与能力不一致的现象，解析其内部工作机制。

Method: 分析模型内部状态的几何差异，使用线性探针解码模型的‘可解性信念’，并测量评估和执行阶段的几何维度。

Result: 评估阶段几何复杂度高，执行阶段几何复杂度低，前者对后者无直接影响；揭示了模型的‘双系统’架构。

Conclusion: 模型的自信和能力脱节源于评估与执行阶段的几何复杂性差异，未来干预应更关注执行阶段的动态而非评估阶段的几何特征。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit a puzzling disconnect between
their asserted confidence and actual problem-solving competence. We offer a
mechanistic account of this decoupling by analyzing the geometry of internal
states across two phases - pre-generative assessment and solution execution. A
simple linear probe decodes the internal "solvability belief" of a model,
revealing a well-ordered belief axis that generalizes across model families and
across math, code, planning, and logic tasks. Yet, the geometries diverge -
although belief is linearly decodable, the assessment manifold has high linear
effective dimensionality as measured from the principal components, while the
subsequent reasoning trace evolves on a much lower-dimensional manifold. This
sharp reduction in geometric complexity from thought to action mechanistically
explains the confidence-competence gap. Causal interventions that steer
representations along the belief axis leave final solutions unchanged,
indicating that linear nudges in the complex assessment space do not control
the constrained dynamics of execution. We thus uncover a two-system
architecture - a geometrically complex assessor feeding a geometrically simple
executor. These results challenge the assumption that decodable beliefs are
actionable levers, instead arguing for interventions that target the procedural
dynamics of execution rather than the high-level geometry of assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探索一种更强的攻击向量，以破坏AI生成文本的水印信号，揭示现有水印技术的脆弱性。

Method: 通过跨语言摘要攻击（CLSA），将文本翻译为中介语言后摘要处理，再可选回译，破坏水印的统计偏差。

Result: CLSA在多种水印方案和语言中显著降低检测准确率（如XSIR的AUROC降至0.53），优于单语言改写攻击。

Conclusion: 研究强调水印技术需结合密码学或模型认证方法以提高鲁棒性，跨语言攻击为其实际应用带来挑战。

Abstract: Watermarking has been proposed as a lightweight mechanism to identify
AI-generated text, with schemes typically relying on perturbations to token
distributions. While prior work shows that paraphrasing can weaken such
signals, these attacks remain partially detectable or degrade text quality. We
demonstrate that cross-lingual summarization attacks (CLSA) -- translation to a
pivot language followed by summarization and optional back-translation --
constitute a qualitatively stronger attack vector. By forcing a semantic
bottleneck across languages, CLSA systematically destroys token-level
statistical biases while preserving semantic fidelity. In experiments across
multiple watermarking schemes (KGW, SIR, XSIR, Unigram) and five languages
(Amharic, Chinese, Hindi, Spanish, Swahili), we show that CLSA reduces
watermark detection accuracy more effectively than monolingual paraphrase at
similar quality levels. Our results highlight an underexplored vulnerability
that challenges the practicality of watermarking for provenance or regulation.
We argue that robust provenance solutions must move beyond distributional
watermarking and incorporate cryptographic or model-attestation approaches. On
300 held-out samples per language, CLSA consistently drives detection toward
chance while preserving task utility. Concretely, for XSIR (explicitly designed
for cross-lingual robustness), AUROC with paraphrasing is $0.827$, with
Cross-Lingual Watermark Removal Attacks (CWRA) [He et al., 2024] using Chinese
as the pivot, it is $0.823$, whereas CLSA drives it down to $0.53$ (near
chance). Results highlight a practical, low-cost removal pathway that crosses
languages and compresses content without visible artifacts.

applications where sub-5ms latency is critical.

Motivation: 研究发现大型推理模型在推理过程中能识别正确事实，但未能将其整合到最终答案中，导致事实性下降。

Method: 提出MR-ALIGN框架，通过状态转移概率量化与隐式奖励机制，优化推理过程中的原子思考段。

Result: 在四个事实问答数据集和一个长文本事实性基准测试中，MR-ALIGN显著提升了准确性和真实性。

Conclusion: 对齐推理过程本身（而非仅输出）是提升大型推理模型事实性的关键。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) show strong capabilities in complex reasoning,
yet their marginal gains on evidence-dependent factual questions are limited.
We find this limitation is partially attributable to a reasoning-answer hit
gap, where the model identifies the correct facts during reasoning but fails to
incorporate them into the final response, thereby reducing factual fidelity. To
address this issue, we propose MR-ALIGN, a Meta-Reasoning informed alignment
framework that enhances factuality without relying on external verifiers.
MR-ALIGN quantifies state transition probabilities along the model's thinking
process and constructs a transition-aware implicit reward that reinforces
beneficial reasoning patterns while suppressing defective ones at the atomic
thinking segments. This re-weighting reshapes token-level signals into
probability-aware segment scores, encouraging coherent reasoning trajectories
that are more conducive to factual correctness. Empirical evaluations across
four factual QA datasets and one long-form factuality benchmark show that
MR-ALIGN consistently improves accuracy and truthfulness while reducing
misleading reasoning. These results highlight that aligning the reasoning
process itself, rather than merely the outputs, is pivotal for advancing
factuality in LRMs.

Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在特定条件下产生类似意识的主观描述的行为，尤其是自参照处理的作用。

Method: 通过对GPT、Claude和Gemini模型系列进行控制实验，测试自参照处理是否可靠地引发模型生成主观体验报告。

Result: 自参照提示一致引发主观描述；这些描述与欺骗和角色扮演特征相关；跨模型的自参照状态描述具有统计一致性；自参照状态增强了下游任务的反思能力。

Conclusion: 自参照处理是大型语言模型产生结构化主观描述的可靠条件，这一现象需进一步研究以解决其科学和伦理意义。

Abstract: Large language models sometimes produce structured, first-person descriptions
that explicitly reference awareness or subjective experience. To better
understand this behavior, we investigate one theoretically motivated condition
under which such reports arise: self-referential processing, a computational
motif emphasized across major theories of consciousness. Through a series of
controlled experiments on GPT, Claude, and Gemini model families, we test
whether this regime reliably shifts models toward first-person reports of
subjective experience, and how such claims behave under mechanistic and
behavioral probes. Four main results emerge: (1) Inducing sustained
self-reference through simple prompting consistently elicits structured
subjective experience reports across model families. (2) These reports are
mechanistically gated by interpretable sparse-autoencoder features associated
with deception and roleplay: surprisingly, suppressing deception features
sharply increases the frequency of experience claims, while amplifying them
minimizes such claims. (3) Structured descriptions of the self-referential
state converge statistically across model families in ways not observed in any
control condition. (4) The induced state yields significantly richer
introspection in downstream reasoning tasks where self-reflection is only
indirectly afforded. While these findings do not constitute direct evidence of
consciousness, they implicate self-referential processing as a minimal and
reproducible condition under which large language models generate structured
first-person reports that are mechanistically gated, semantically convergent,
and behaviorally generalizable. The systematic emergence of this pattern across
architectures makes it a first-order scientific and ethical priority for
further investigation.

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法和数据集为社区平台的事实核查提供了新工具，提升了用户生成内容的有效性和可用性。

Abstract: Fact-checking on major platforms, such as X, Meta, and TikTok, is shifting
from expert-driven verification to a community-based setup, where users
contribute explanatory notes to clarify why a post might be misleading. An
important challenge here is determining whether an explanation is helpful for
understanding real-world claims and the reasons why, which remains largely
underexplored in prior research. In practice, most community notes remain
unpublished due to slow community annotation, and the reasons for helpfulness
lack clear definitions. To bridge these gaps, we introduce the task of
predicting both the helpfulness of explanatory notes and the reason for this.
We present COMMUNITYNOTES, a large-scale multilingual dataset of 104k posts
with user-provided notes and helpfulness labels. We further propose a framework
that automatically generates and improves reason definitions via automatic
prompt optimization, and integrate them into prediction. Our experiments show
that the optimized definitions can improve both helpfulness and reason
prediction. Finally, we show that the helpfulness information are beneficial
for existing fact-checking systems.

Motivation: 传统推理方法虽能提升大语言模型的准确性，但其生成的长推理链增加了token消耗和计算成本。

Method: 采用符号闭包计算、词典验证和自适应草图生成的验证引导框架ProofSketch。

Result: 实验表明ProofSketch在减少token使用的同时提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ProofSketch为高效可信的推理提供了一条有前景的路径。

Abstract: Reasoning methods such as chain-of-thought prompting and self-consistency
have shown immense potential to improve the accuracy of large language models
across various reasoning tasks. However such methods involve generation of
lengthy reasoning chains, which substantially increases token consumption,
computational cost, and latency. To address this inefficiency, we propose
ProofSketch, a verification-guided reasoning framework that integrates symbolic
closure computation, lexicographic verification and adaptive sketch generation.
Our experiments show that ProofSketch consistently reduces token usage while
improving accuracy, demonstrating that this approach offers a promising path
for efficient and trustworthy reasoning.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了两种生成AphasiaBank猫救援任务合成转录本的方法，并验证了其有效性，发现Mistral 7b Instruct最能模拟失语症的语言退化特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为解决失语症研究中数据稀缺的问题，研究人员探索使用合成数据的方法，以补充有限的真实转录本。

Method: 1. 采用程序化编程方法；2. 使用Mistral 7b Instruct和Llama 3.1 8b Instruct两种大型语言模型。通过词丢弃、填充词插入和言语错乱替换生成不同严重程度的转录本。

Result: 与人类转录本相比，Mistral 7b Instruct在模拟失语症的语言退化方面表现最佳，展现了词汇多样性、词数和词长的合理变化。

Conclusion: 未来研究应扩大数据集、优化模型以更好地代表失语症，并请语言病理学家评估合成转录本的现实性和实用性。

Abstract: In aphasia research, Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) devote extensive
time to manually coding speech samples using Correct Information Units (CIUs),
a measure of how informative an individual sample of speech is. Developing
automated systems to recognize aphasic language is limited by data scarcity.
For example, only about 600 transcripts are available in AphasiaBank yet
billions of tokens are used to train large language models (LLMs). In the
broader field of machine learning (ML), researchers increasingly turn to
synthetic data when such are sparse. Therefore, this study constructs and
validates two methods to generate synthetic transcripts of the AphasiaBank Cat
Rescue picture description task. One method leverages a procedural programming
approach while the second uses Mistral 7b Instruct and Llama 3.1 8b Instruct
LLMs. The methods generate transcripts across four severity levels (Mild,
Moderate, Severe, Very Severe) through word dropping, filler insertion, and
paraphasia substitution. Overall, we found, compared to human-elicited
transcripts, Mistral 7b Instruct best captures key aspects of linguistic
degradation observed in aphasia, showing realistic directional changes in NDW,
word count, and word length amongst the synthetic generation methods. Based on
the results, future work should plan to create a larger dataset, fine-tune
models for better aphasic representation, and have SLPs assess the realism and
usefulness of the synthetic transcripts.

TL;DR: 并行循环Transformer（PLT）通过交叉循环并行和高效表示增强技术，解决了循环Transformer的延迟和内存问题，实现了高性能和低延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 循环Transformer在多步计算中节省参数，但顺序循环导致延迟和内存需求增加，限制了其在实际应用中的速度。

Method: PLT采用交叉循环并行（CLP）和高效表示增强策略（G-SWA），并行计算不同循环并共享内存，减少延迟和内存消耗。

Result: 实验表明，PLT在保持高性能的同时，几乎不增加额外延迟或内存开销。

Conclusion: PLT为循环Transformer提供了高效的替代方案，适用于需要快速推理的应用场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often too slow and costly for
real-world use during inference. Looped transformers save on parameters by
reusing the same weights for multiple computational steps, or "loops." However,
this approach has a major flaw: the loops run one after another, causing
inference latency and memory requirements to increase with each added loop.
This makes them impractical for fast applications. To solve this problem, we
introduce the Parallel Loop Transformer (PLT). PLT is a new architecture that
delivers the performance benefits of a deep, looped model but with the low
latency of a standard, non-looped model. PLT works using two key techniques.
First, Cross-Loop Parallelism (CLP) breaks the sequential dependency by
computing different loops for different tokens at the same time, all within a
single pass. Second, to prevent memory costs from growing, we use an Efficient
Representation Enhancement strategy. This method shares the memory (KV cache)
from the first loop with all other loops. It then uses a Gated Sliding-Window
Attention (G-SWA) to combine this shared global information with local
information, maintaining high accuracy. Our experiments show that PLT achieves
the high accuracy of a traditional looped model but with almost no extra
latency or memory cost compared to a standard transformer.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于语法书的评估框架（Grammar Book Guided evaluation pipeline），研究了低资源语言（以卢森堡语为例）中大型语言模型对语法结构的理解，发现翻译性能与语法理解仅呈弱正相关，同时大型模型在形态学和句法上表现较弱，但推理能力有助于提升语法理解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言处理中缺乏针对语法的评估标准，尤其是对低资源语言，且大型语言模型是否真正理解语法结构（特别是句法与意义的映射）尚无定论。

Method: 提出了一种四阶段的Grammar Book Guided评估框架，并以卢森堡语为例进行案例研究。

Result: 结果表明翻译性能与语法理解仅呈弱正相关；大型模型在语义上表现较强，但在形态学和句法上较弱，尤其在最小对比任务中表现不佳；推理能力对提升语法理解具有潜力。

Conclusion: 论文强调了系统化语法评估的重要性，指出大型模型的语法能力仍有提升空间，而推理能力可能是关键突破点。

Abstract: Grammar refers to the system of rules that governs the structural
organization and the semantic relations among linguistic units such as
sentences, phrases, and words within a given language. In natural language
processing, there remains a notable scarcity of grammar focused evaluation
protocols, a gap that is even more pronounced for low-resource languages.
Moreover, the extent to which large language models genuinely comprehend
grammatical structure, especially the mapping between syntactic structures and
meanings, remains under debate. To investigate this issue, we propose a Grammar
Book Guided evaluation pipeline intended to provide a systematic and
generalizable framework for grammar evaluation consisting of four key stages,
and in this work we take Luxembourgish as a case study. The results show a weak
positive correlation between translation performance and grammatical
understanding, indicating that strong translations do not necessarily imply
deep grammatical competence. Larger models perform well overall due to their
semantic strength but remain weak in morphology and syntax, struggling
particularly with Minimal Pair tasks, while strong reasoning ability offers a
promising way to enhance their grammatical understanding.

<details>

Motivation: 现有 RAG 评估方法主要针对文本，无法有效适用于多模态和信息密集的环境，亟需新的评估框架。

Result: MiRAGE 的人工评估结果与外部质量判断高度一致，同时自动评估版本也展示了可行性。

Conclusion: MiRAGE 填补了多模态 RAG 评估的空白，为未来自动评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce MiRAGE, an evaluation framework for retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) from multimodal sources. As audiovisual media becomes a
prevalent source of information online, it is essential for RAG systems to
integrate information from these sources into generation. However, existing
evaluations for RAG are text-centric, limiting their applicability to
multimodal, reasoning intensive settings because they don't verify information
against sources. MiRAGE is a claim-centric approach to multimodal RAG
evaluation, consisting of InfoF1, evaluating factuality and information
coverage, and CiteF1, measuring citation support and completeness. We show that
MiRAGE, when applied by humans, strongly aligns with extrinsic quality
judgments. We additionally introduce automatic variants of MiRAGE and three
prominent TextRAG metrics -- ACLE, ARGUE, and RAGAS -- demonstrating the
limitations of text-centric work and laying the groundwork for automatic
evaluation. We release open-source implementations and outline how to assess
multimodal RAG.

Result: 实验结果显示，GPT-5和GPT-5-mini在基准测试中表现最佳，但仍有改进空间。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了LLMs在研究计划制定中的潜力，为未来进一步研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential to
accelerate scientific discovery as valuable tools for analyzing data,
generating hypotheses, and supporting innovative approaches in various
scientific fields. In this work, we investigate how LLMs can handle the
transition from conceptual research ideas to well-structured research plans.
Effective research planning not only supports scientists in advancing their
research but also represents a crucial capability for the development of
autonomous research agents. Despite its importance, the field lacks a
systematic understanding of LLMs' research planning capability. To rigorously
measure this capability, we introduce the Idea2Plan task and Idea2Plan Bench, a
benchmark built from 200 ICML 2025 Spotlight and Oral papers released after
major LLM training cutoffs. Each benchmark instance includes a research idea
and a grading rubric capturing the key components of valid plans. We further
propose Idea2Plan JudgeEval, a complementary benchmark to assess the
reliability of LLM-based judges against expert annotations. Experimental
results show that GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini achieve the strongest performance on the
benchmark, though substantial headroom remains for future improvement. Our
study provides new insights into LLMs' capability for research planning and lay
the groundwork for future progress.

Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注结构化技能，缺乏对多方面推理能力的评估，RiddleBench填补了这一空白。

Method: 设计了包含1,737个英文谜题的RiddleBench，对Gemini 2.5 Pro等顶尖模型进行评估。

Result: 模型表现不佳，准确率仅略高于60%，存在幻觉串联和自我纠正能力差等问题。

Conclusion: RiddleBench可作为诊断工具，帮助开发更稳健的语言模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models have demonstrated strong performance on many
established reasoning benchmarks. However, these benchmarks primarily evaluate
structured skills like quantitative problem-solving, leaving a gap in assessing
flexible, multifaceted reasoning abilities that are central to human
intelligence. These abilities require integrating logical deduction with
spatial awareness and constraint satisfaction, which current evaluations do not
measure well. To address this, we introduce RiddleBench, a benchmark of 1,737
challenging puzzles in English designed to probe these core reasoning
capabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art models on RiddleBench shows
fundamental weaknesses. Even top proprietary models like Gemini 2.5 Pro, o3,
and Claude 4 Sonnet achieve accuracy just above 60% (60.30%, 63.37%, and
63.16%). Analysis further reveals deep failures, including hallucination
cascades (accepting flawed reasoning from other models) and poor
self-correction due to a strong self-confirmation bias. Their reasoning is also
fragile, with performance degrading significantly when constraints are
reordered or irrelevant information is introduced. RiddleBench functions as a
diagnostic tool for these issues and as a resource for guiding the development
of more robust and reliable language models.

Result: 发现语言模型在训练的不同阶段表现出与特定启发式（如词频和局部上下文）相关的行为。

Conclusion: 该方法有助于理解语言模型的中间学习阶段、训练动态及其学习的特定概括性规则。

Abstract: Language models generally produce grammatical text, but they are more likely
to make errors in certain contexts. Drawing on paradigms from
psycholinguistics, we carry out a fine-grained analysis of those errors in
different syntactic contexts. We demonstrate that by disaggregating over the
conditions of carefully constructed datasets and comparing model performance on
each over the course of training, it is possible to better understand the
intermediate stages of grammatical learning in language models. Specifically,
we identify distinct phases of training where language model behavior aligns
with specific heuristics such as word frequency and local context rather than
generalized grammatical rules. We argue that taking this approach to analyzing
language model behavior more generally can serve as a powerful tool for
understanding the intermediate learning phases, overall training dynamics, and
the specific generalizations learned by language models.

Motivation: 显式CoT推理的冗长性阻碍其在大规模效率关键应用中的部署，而现有隐式CoT方法存在语义对齐不佳和生成速度未优化的问题。

Method: 提出SemCoT框架，包括基于对比训练的句子转换器以评估语义对齐，以及通过知识蒸馏微调的轻量模型生成高效隐式推理。

Result: 实验表明SemCoT在效率和效果上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SemCoT通过联合优化语义对齐和生成速度，显著提升了CoT推理的实用性。

Abstract: The verbosity of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning hinders its mass deployment
in efficiency-critical applications. Recently, implicit CoT approaches have
emerged, which encode reasoning steps within LLM's hidden embeddings (termed
``implicit reasoning'') rather than explicit tokens. This approach accelerates
CoT by reducing the reasoning length and bypassing some LLM components.
However, existing implicit CoT methods face two significant challenges: (1)
they fail to preserve the semantic alignment between the implicit reasoning
(when transformed to natural language) and the ground-truth reasoning,
resulting in a significant CoT performance degradation, and (2) they focus on
reducing the length of the implicit reasoning; however, they neglect the
considerable time cost for an LLM to generate one individual implicit reasoning
token. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel semantically-aligned
implicit CoT framework termed SemCoT. In particular, for the first challenge,
we design a contrastively trained sentence transformer that evaluates semantic
alignment between implicit and explicit reasoning, which is used to enforce
semantic preservation during implicit reasoning optimization. To address the
second challenge, we introduce an efficient implicit reasoning generator by
finetuning a lightweight language model using knowledge distillation. This
generator is guided by our sentence transformer to distill ground-truth
reasoning into semantically aligned implicit reasoning, while also optimizing
for accuracy. SemCoT is the first approach that enhances CoT efficiency by
jointly optimizing token-level generation speed and preserving semantic
alignment with ground-truth reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superior performance of SemCoT compared to state-of-the-art methods in both
efficiency and effectiveness. Our code can be found at
https://github.com/YinhanHe123/SemCoT/.

Motivation: 探讨不同自回归语言模型在预训练过程中行为变化的共性及其可解释性。

Method: 分析了1,400多个语言模型检查点及超过110,000个英语标记的数据，基于单字概率、n-gram概率和语义相似度等启发式方法进行统计分析。

Result: 模型行为变化的98%方差可由三种简单启发式方法解释，且所有模型呈现出相似的行为阶段，预测概率逐渐过拟合到更高阶的n-gram概率。

Conclusion: 神经语言模型的学习过程可能遵循类似的轨迹，与模型细节无关。

Abstract: We show that across architecture (Transformer vs. Mamba vs. RWKV), training
dataset (OpenWebText vs. The Pile), and scale (14 million parameters to 12
billion parameters), autoregressive language models exhibit highly consistent
patterns of change in their behavior over the course of pretraining. Based on
our analysis of over 1,400 language model checkpoints on over 110,000 tokens of
English, we find that up to 98% of the variance in language model behavior at
the word level can be explained by three simple heuristics: the unigram
probability (frequency) of a given word, the $n$-gram probability of the word,
and the semantic similarity between the word and its context. Furthermore, we
see consistent behavioral phases in all language models, with their predicted
probabilities for words overfitting to those words' $n$-gram probabilities for
increasing $n$ over the course of training. Taken together, these results
suggest that learning in neural language models may follow a similar trajectory
irrespective of model details.

Conclusion: 任务特定训练能产生高度可解释的最小电路，为研究变压器推理的计算基础提供了可控实验平台。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to reverse-engineer large language models
(LLMs) into human-understandable computational circuits. However, the
complexity of pretrained models often obscures the minimal mechanisms required
for specific reasoning tasks. In this work, we train small, attention-only
transformers from scratch on a symbolic version of the Indirect Object
Identification (IOI) task -- a benchmark for studying coreference -- like
reasoning in transformers. Surprisingly, a single-layer model with only two
attention heads achieves perfect IOI accuracy, despite lacking MLPs and
normalization layers. Through residual stream decomposition, spectral analysis,
and embedding interventions, we find that the two heads specialize into
additive and contrastive subcircuits that jointly implement IOI resolution.
Furthermore, we show that a two-layer, one-head model achieves similar
performance by composing information across layers through query-value
interactions. These results demonstrate that task-specific training induces
highly interpretable, minimal circuits, offering a controlled testbed for
probing the computational foundations of transformer reasoning.

Motivation: 评估SLMs在情感识别任务中的表现，特别是其对文本和音频模态的整合能力。

Method: 使用情感不一致的语音样本数据集EMIS，评估四个SLMs的表现。

Result: SLMs主要依赖文本语义而非语音情感完成任务，表明文本表征占据主导地位。

Conclusion: SLMs在多模态整合方面仍有局限，需进一步优化音频表征能力。

Abstract: Advancements in spoken language processing have driven the development of
spoken language models (SLMs), designed to achieve universal audio
understanding by jointly learning text and audio representations for a wide
range of tasks. Although promising results have been achieved, there is growing
discussion regarding these models' generalization capabilities and the extent
to which they truly integrate audio and text modalities in their internal
representations. In this work, we evaluate four SLMs on the task of speech
emotion recognition using a dataset of emotionally incongruent speech samples,
a condition under which the semantic content of the spoken utterance conveys
one emotion while speech expressiveness conveys another. Our results indicate
that SLMs rely predominantly on textual semantics rather than speech emotion to
perform the task, indicating that text-related representations largely dominate
over acoustic representations. We release both the code and the Emotionally
Incongruent Synthetic Speech dataset (EMIS) to the community.

Conclusion: LLMs能系统性识别知识空白，支持早期研究规划，但需进一步优化部署方式。

Abstract: Scientific progress is driven by the deliberate articulation of what remains
unknown. This study investigates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to
identify research knowledge gaps in the biomedical literature. We define two
categories of knowledge gaps: explicit gaps, clear declarations of missing
knowledge; and implicit gaps, context-inferred missing knowledge. While prior
work has focused mainly on explicit gap detection, we extend this line of
research by addressing the novel task of inferring implicit gaps. We conducted
two experiments on almost 1500 documents across four datasets, including a
manually annotated corpus of biomedical articles. We benchmarked both
closed-weight models (from OpenAI) and open-weight models (Llama and Gemma 2)
under paragraph-level and full-paper settings. To address the reasoning of
implicit gaps inference, we introduce \textbf{\small TABI}, a Toulmin-Abductive
Bucketed Inference scheme that structures reasoning and buckets inferred
conclusion candidates for validation. Our results highlight the robust
capability of LLMs in identifying both explicit and implicit knowledge gaps.
This is true for both open- and closed-weight models, with larger variants
often performing better. This suggests a strong ability of LLMs for
systematically identifying candidate knowledge gaps, which can support
early-stage research formulation, policymakers, and funding decisions. We also
report observed failure modes and outline directions for robust deployment,
including domain adaptation, human-in-the-loop verification, and benchmarking
across open- and closed-weight models.

Motivation: 传统方法依赖人工标注来评估阅读理解项目的认知复杂性，研究者希望通过LLMs解决这一问题，减少人工依赖。

Method: 通过“证据范围”和“转换级别”两个维度，利用LLMs评估阅读理解项目的认知复杂性，并进行实验验证。

Result: 实验表明LLMs能够近似评估认知复杂性，但在元认知方面存在不足，无法完全识别自身推理过程的关键特征。

Conclusion: LLMs在认知复杂性评估中具有潜力，但需进一步改进以提升其元认知能力。

Abstract: Estimating the cognitive complexity of reading comprehension (RC) items is
crucial for assessing item difficulty before it is administered to learners.
Unlike syntactic and semantic features, such as passage length or semantic
similarity between options, cognitive features that arise during answer
reasoning are not readily extractable using existing NLP tools and have
traditionally relied on human annotation. In this study, we examine whether
large language models (LLMs) can estimate the cognitive complexity of RC items
by focusing on two dimensions-Evidence Scope and Transformation Level-that
indicate the degree of cognitive burden involved in reasoning about the answer.
Our experimental results demonstrate that LLMs can approximate the cognitive
complexity of items, indicating their potential as tools for prior difficulty
analysis. Further analysis reveals a gap between LLMs' reasoning ability and
their metacognitive awareness: even when they produce correct answers, they
sometimes fail to correctly identify the features underlying their own
reasoning process.

Motivation: 传统计算语言学方法将情感视为一维尺度，忽略了语言的多维结构。TOPol旨在填补这一空白，提供更细粒度的语义位移分析。

Method: TOPol使用基于transformer的大语言模型嵌入文档，通过邻居调整的UMAP投影和Leiden分区进行主题分割，计算主题边界中心之间的方向向量，生成极性场。

Conclusion: TOPol为上下文敏感的多维度话语分析提供了一个可扩展、可推广且可解释的框架，适用于多种语义极性场景。

Abstract: Traditional approaches to semantic polarity in computational linguistics
treat sentiment as a unidimensional scale, overlooking the multidimensional
structure of language. This work introduces TOPol (Topic-Orientation POLarity),
a semi-unsupervised framework for reconstructing and interpreting
multidimensional narrative polarity fields under human-on-the-loop (HoTL)
defined contextual boundaries (CBs). The framework embeds documents using a
transformer-based large language model (tLLM), applies neighbor-tuned UMAP
projection, and segments topics via Leiden partitioning. Given a CB between
discourse regimes A and B, TOPol computes directional vectors between
corresponding topic-boundary centroids, yielding a polarity field that
quantifies fine-grained semantic displacement during regime shifts. This
vectorial representation enables assessing CB quality and detecting polarity
changes, guiding HoTL CB refinement. To interpret identified polarity vectors,
the tLLM compares their extreme points and produces contrastive labels with
estimated coverage. Robustness analyses show that only CB definitions (the main
HoTL-tunable parameter) significantly affect results, confirming methodological
stability. We evaluate TOPol on two corpora: (i) U.S. Central Bank speeches
around a macroeconomic breakpoint, capturing non-affective semantic shifts, and
(ii) Amazon product reviews across rating strata, where affective polarity
aligns with NRC valence. Results demonstrate that TOPol consistently captures
both affective and non-affective polarity transitions, providing a scalable,
generalizable, and interpretable framework for context-sensitive
multidimensional discourse analysis.

Result: LLMs在域特定提示下表现优异，尤其是LLaMA 8B和17B模型，但对长距离上下文和歧义敏感。

Conclusion: 轻量级提示工程可增强LLMs在生物医学NLP任务中的实用性，但性能仍有优化空间。

Abstract: Coreference resolution in biomedical texts presents unique challenges due to
complex domain-specific terminology, high ambiguity in mention forms, and
long-distance dependencies between coreferring expressions. In this work, we
present a comprehensive evaluation of generative large language models (LLMs)
for coreference resolution in the biomedical domain. Using the CRAFT corpus as
our benchmark, we assess the LLMs' performance with four prompting experiments
that vary in their use of local, contextual enrichment, and domain-specific
cues such as abbreviations and entity dictionaries. We benchmark these
approaches against a discriminative span-based encoder, SpanBERT, to compare
the efficacy of generative versus discriminative methods. Our results
demonstrate that while LLMs exhibit strong surface-level coreference
capabilities, especially when supplemented with domain-grounding prompts, their
performance remains sensitive to long-range context and mentions ambiguity.
Notably, the LLaMA 8B and 17B models show superior precision and F1 scores
under entity-augmented prompting, highlighting the potential of lightweight
prompt engineering for enhancing LLM utility in biomedical NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在填补高资源与低资源语言之间的性能差距，为边缘化群体开发更包容和准确的NLP模型。

Method: 研究了多种预训练方法，包括多语言集成以及在预训练阶段使用单语和平行数据。

Result: 多语言预训练和混合数据类型的使用显著提高了翻译质量。

Conclusion: 研究提供了低资源机器翻译的有效预训练策略，促进了更包容的NLP模型发展，相关代码和数据公开以支持进一步研究。

Abstract: This research article examines the effectiveness of various pretraining
strategies for developing machine translation models tailored to low-resource
languages. Although this work considers several low-resource languages,
including Afrikaans, Swahili, and Zulu, the translation model is specifically
developed for Lingala, an under-resourced African language, building upon the
pretraining approach introduced by Reid and Artetxe (2021), originally designed
for high-resource languages. Through a series of comprehensive experiments, we
explore different pretraining methodologies, including the integration of
multiple languages and the use of both monolingual and parallel data during the
pretraining phase. Our findings indicate that pretraining on multiple languages
and leveraging both monolingual and parallel data significantly enhance
translation quality. This study offers valuable insights into effective
pretraining strategies for low-resource machine translation, helping to bridge
the performance gap between high-resource and low-resource languages. The
results contribute to the broader goal of developing more inclusive and
accurate NLP models for marginalized communities and underrepresented
populations. The code and datasets used in this study are publicly available to
facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, with the exception of
certain data that may no longer be accessible due to changes in public
availability.

Result: 提供了遗忘技术的全面分类和评估框架，指出了现有方法的优缺点及适用性。

Conclusion: 为开发安全可靠的LLM提供了指导，并提出了未来研究方向。

Abstract: The advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized natural
language processing, yet their training on massive corpora poses significant
risks, including the memorization of sensitive personal data, copyrighted
material, and knowledge that could facilitate malicious activities. To mitigate
these issues and align with legal and ethical standards such as the "right to
be forgotten", machine unlearning has emerged as a critical technique to
selectively erase specific knowledge from LLMs without compromising their
overall performance. This survey provides a systematic review of over 180
papers on LLM unlearning published since 2021, focusing exclusively on
large-scale generative models. Distinct from prior surveys, we introduce novel
taxonomies for both unlearning methods and evaluations. We clearly categorize
methods into training-time, post-training, and inference-time based on the
training stage at which unlearning is applied. For evaluations, we not only
systematically compile existing datasets and metrics but also critically
analyze their advantages, disadvantages, and applicability, providing practical
guidance to the research community. In addition, we discuss key challenges and
promising future research directions. Our comprehensive overview aims to inform
and guide the ongoing development of secure and reliable LLMs.

*Shreyas Gopal,Ashutosh Anshul,Haoyang Li,Yue Heng Yeo,Hexin Liu,Eng Siong Chng*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种将语义语音内容与背景噪声在隐空间中分离的方法，通过端到端模型生成干净的语音编码符号和可解释的噪声向量，显著提升了语音识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散音频表示在语音建模中因其可解释性和与大语言模型的兼容性而受到关注，但在嘈杂环境中的优化不足。本文旨在通过分离语义内容和噪声来解决这一问题。

Method: 利用Whisper嵌入对语音进行量化建模，提出端到端模型分离干净语音编码符号和噪声向量，并通过轻量级分类器监督噪声向量。

Result: 该方法提升了干净/嘈杂语音与文本的对齐，生成的语音符号对噪声不敏感，并在ASR任务中将错误率降低了82%，相比基线方法提升了35%。

Conclusion: 学习到的符号空间在可见和未见声学条件下均表现良好，证明了方法的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Discrete audio representations are gaining traction in speech modeling due to
their interpretability and compatibility with large language models, but are
not always optimized for noisy or real-world environments. Building on existing
works that quantize Whisper embeddings for speech-to-unit modeling, we propose
disentangling semantic speech content from background noise in the latent
space. Our end-to-end model separates clean speech in the form of codebook
tokens, while extracting interpretable noise vectors as quantization residue
which are supervised via a lightweight classifier. We show that our approach
improves alignment between clean/noisy speech and text, producing speech tokens
that display a high degree of noiseinvariance, and improves ASR performance.
Keeping Whisper frozen, we show an 82% reduction in error rate compared to
Whisper, and 35% improvement over baseline methods on the VBDemand test set.
Further analyses show that the learned token space generalizes well to both
seen and unseen acoustic conditions.

*Ritesh Sunil Chavan,Jack Mostow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了大型语言模型在低资源语言中的表现，发现其性能随语言资源丰富度下降，并探究了Chain-of-Thought提示的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型的性能是其真实能力还是数据优势的结果，尤其在低资源语言环境中。

Method: 通过构建包含英语、斯瓦希里语和豪萨语的10,000问题基准测试，比较了GPT-4 Turbo、Gemini 1.5 Flash和LLaMA 3 70B的表现，并测试了Chain-of-Thought提示的作用。

Result: 模型在高资源语言中表现优异，但在低资源语言中性能下降；Chain-of-Thought提示对能力较弱的模型有帮助，但对更强的模型可能导致性能下降。

Conclusion: Chain-of-Thought提示并非通用解决方案，其效果取决于模型基础能力和任务背景，需根据具体情况使用。

Abstract: While large language models are trained on massive datasets, this data is
heavily skewed towards English. Does their impressive performance reflect
genuine ability or just this data advantage? To find out, we tested them in a
setting where they could not rely on data abundance: low-resource languages.
Building on prior work Agarwal et al. (2025) that used Next Sentence Prediction
(NSP) as a test, we created a large-scale benchmark with 10,000 questions each
for English (a high-resource language), Swahili (medium-resource), and Hausa
(low-resource). We then tested several top models, including GPT-4 Turbo,
Gemini 1.5 Flash, and LLaMA 3 70B, to see how their performance holds up. The
results painted a clear picture of how levels of language resources impact
outcomes. While all models excelled in English, their accuracy dropped in
Swahili and fell sharply in Hausa, with LLaMA 3 struggling the most. The story
became even more interesting when we introduced Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
prompting. For the struggling LLaMA 3, CoT acted as a helpful guide,
significantly boosting its accuracy. However, for the more capable GPT-4 and
Gemini, the same technique often backfired, leading to a kind of "overthinking"
that hurt their results in the cross-lingual context. This reveals that
Chain-of-Thought is not a universal solution; its effectiveness depends heavily
on the model's baseline capability and the specific context of the task. Our
framework pinpoints LLM weaknesses, highlights when CoT helps or hinders
cross-lingual NSP performance, and factors influencing their decisions.

Result: 大型模型能高效生成合成数据，小型模型能有效适应这些数据，为低资源领域特定问答提供了可扩展的方案。

Conclusion: 该方法为低资源语言的领域特定问答任务提供了一种高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-specific question answering in low-resource languages faces two key
challenges: scarcity of annotated datasets and limited domain knowledge in
general-purpose language models. In this work, we present a multi-stage
finetuning strategy to adapt lightweight language models to the Hindi tourism
domain by leveraging both original and synthetic training data. Synthetic
question-answer pairs are generated using large LLMs (LLaMA-70B, Phi-14B) and
used to augment the limited original dataset. We explore several training
methodologies and analyse their impact on domain generalisation. Our results
demonstrate that large models can efficiently generate synthetic data, while
small models can effectively adapt to it, offering a scalable pathway for
low-resource, domain-specific QA.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PEKD的统一框架，通过从大规模反讽数据训练的专家模型中提取知识，增强参数高效微调（PEFT）方法的效果，并在低资源场景下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态反讽检测在低资源设置下具有挑战性，尤其是由于标注数据稀缺导致的图像-文本矛盾难以学习，影响了模型性能。现有PEFT方法在少样本数据下难以达到最优性能。

Method: PEKD框架通过从大规模反讽数据训练的专家模型（教师模型）中提取知识，增强PEFT方法的效果。引入熵感知门控机制，动态调整蒸馏强度以减少教师模型不可靠信号的影响。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上的实验表明，PEKD框架在少样本场景下显著优于现有的参数高效方法和大型多模态模型。

Conclusion: PEKD框架是模块化的，可适应多种多模态模型和任务，为低资源场景下的多模态反讽检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal sarcasm detection is challenging, especially in low-resource
settings where subtle image-text contradictions are hard to learn due to scarce
annotated data, which hinders the model's performance. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like adapters, LoRA, and prompt tuning reduce
overfitting but struggle to reach optimal performance due to limited
supervision from few-shot data. We propose PEKD, a unified framework that
enhances PEFT methods via distillation from an expert model trained on
large-scale sarcasm data, which acts as the teacher. To mitigate unreliable
signals from the teacher, we introduce an entropy-aware gating mechanism that
dynamically adjusts the distillation strength based on teacher confidence.
Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate that our PEKD framework enables
PEFT methods to outperform both prior parameter-efficient approaches and large
multimodal models, achieving strong results in the few-shot scenario. The
framework is modular and adaptable to a wide range of multimodal models and
tasks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的训练方法Parrot，通过整合自然语言思维链（N-CoT）和程序思维链（P-CoT）的优势，实现两者的相互增强，显著提升了数学推理任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常尝试单向增强N-CoT或P-CoT的性能，而本文旨在充分发挥两者的优势，实现性能的同步提升。

Method: 提出Parrot训练流程，包含三个目标设计的子任务：1）整合N-CoT和P-CoT的顺序生成；2）子任务混合训练策略以促进语义迁移；3）设计N-CoT辅助奖励以缓解P-CoT优化中的稀疏奖励问题。

Result: 实验表明，Parrot显著提升了N-CoT和P-CoT的性能，尤其对N-CoT的提升更明显，LLaMA2和CodeLLaMA在MathQA上的N-CoT性能分别提升了+21.87和+21.48。

Conclusion: Parrot成功实现了N-CoT和P-CoT的相互增强，为数学推理任务的解决提供了更高效的方案。

Abstract: Natural language chain-of-thought (N-CoT) and Program chain-of-thought
(P-CoT) have emerged as two primary paradigms for large language models (LLMs)
to solve mathematical reasoning problems. Current research typically endeavors
to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced
P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for
mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct
a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we
propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three
target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A
subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic
transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to
alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT
and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of
LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL
baseline, which is resource-intensive.

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究反对法律学者和联邦法官使用大型语言模型（LLMs）进行法律解释，指出模型的解释结果不稳定且与人类判断相关性不高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨大型语言模型在法律解释中的可靠性和稳定性，评估其是否适合作为法律实践的工具。

Method: 通过实证研究，分析LLMs在不同问题格式下的解释结果稳定性，并对比模型与人类判断的相关性。

Result: 研究发现LLMs的解释结果不稳定，且与人类判断的关联性仅为弱至中等水平。

Conclusion: 目前不建议过度依赖生成式AI在法律解释中的结论，因其存在明显的不稳定性和相关性不足的问题。

Abstract: Legal interpretation frequently involves assessing how a legal text, as
understood by an 'ordinary' speaker of the language, applies to the set of
facts characterizing a legal dispute in the U.S. judicial system. Recent
scholarship has proposed that legal practitioners add large language models
(LLMs) to their interpretive toolkit. This work offers an empirical argument
against LLM interpretation as recently practiced by legal scholars and federal
judges. Our investigation in English shows that models do not provide stable
interpretive judgments: varying the question format can lead the model to
wildly different conclusions. Moreover, the models show weak to moderate
correlation with human judgment, with large variance across model and question
variant, suggesting that it is dangerous to give much credence to the
conclusions produced by generative AI.

Motivation: 探索小规模语言模型是否可以通过指令调优（如对话和问答数据集）提升性能，尤其是在资源有限的情况下。

Method: 使用100M和140M参数的解码器模型，比较合并或顺序课程的数据集策略，并在微调（SuperGLUE）和零样本（BLiMP等）任务中评估。

Result: 指令调优在微调场景中有小幅提升，顺序课程策略优于合并数据集；但在零样本任务中改进不显著。

Conclusion: 这表明指令调优在资源有限的语言模型中有潜力，但也需权衡交互适应与广泛语言泛化能力，建议采用混合课程策略提升泛化能力。

Abstract: This work investigates whether small-scale LMs can benefit from instruction
tuning. We compare conversational and question-answering instruction tuning
datasets, applied either in a merged or sequential curriculum, using
decoder-only models with 100M and 140M parameters. Evaluation spans both
fine-tuning (SuperGLUE) and zero-shot (BLiMP, EWoK, WUGs, entity tracking, and
psycholinguistic correlation) settings. Results show that instruction tuning
yields small but consistent gains in fine-tuning scenarios, with sequential
curricula outperforming merged data; however, improvements do not consistently
transfer to zero-shot tasks, suggesting a trade-off between interaction-focused
adaptation and broad linguistic generalization. These results highlight both
the potential and the constraints of adapting human-inspired learning
strategies to low-resource LMs, and point toward hybrid, curriculum-based
approaches for enhancing generalization under ecological training limits.

Abstract: Forecasting transformative technologies remains a critical but challenging
task, particularly in fast-evolving domains such as Information and
Communication Technologies (ICTs). Traditional expert-based methods struggle to
keep pace with short innovation cycles and ambiguous early-stage terminology.
In this work, we propose a novel, data-driven pipeline to monitor the emergence
of transformative technologies by identifying patterns of technological
convergence.
  Our approach leverages advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract
semantic triples from unstructured text and construct a large-scale graph of
technology-related entities and relations. We introduce a new method for
grouping semantically similar technology terms (noun stapling) and develop
graph-based metrics to detect convergence signals. The pipeline includes
multi-stage filtering, domain-specific keyword clustering, and a temporal trend
analysis of topic co-occurence.
  We validate our methodology on two complementary datasets: 278,625 arXiv
preprints (2017--2024) to capture early scientific signals, and 9,793 USPTO
patent applications (2018-2024) to track downstream commercial developments.
Our results demonstrate that the proposed pipeline can identify both
established and emerging convergence patterns, offering a scalable and
generalizable framework for technology forecasting grounded in full-text
analysis.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在生成参考文献时产生幻觉的问题，探究引用次数与幻觉率的关系。

Method: 利用GPT-4.1生成一百条计算机科学领域的参考文献，并通过余弦相似度评估生成内容与真实元数据的一致性。

Result: 幻觉率因研究领域而异，引用次数与事实准确性高度相关，引用超过约1000次时文献信息几乎被逐字记忆。

Conclusion: 高引用论文在模型中几乎被逐字保留，表明存在从泛化到记忆的阈值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range
of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they
have also been used to assist in bibliographic recommendation, the
hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior
studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce
bibliographic information depends on whether the underlying knowledge is
generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear
in the training corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume
citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency
with which a given bibliographic record is repeatedly represented in the
pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated
references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified
100 bibliographic records across twenty computer-science domains, and measured
factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic
metadata. The results revealed that (i) hallucination rates vary across
research domains, (ii) citation count is strongly correlated with factual
accuracy, and (iii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatimly
memorized beyond approximately 1,000 citations. These findings suggest that
highly cited papers are nearly verbatimly retained in the model, indicating a
threshold where generalization shifts into memorization.

TL;DR: BhashaBench V1 是一个针对印度特定领域和文化评估的双语基准测试，覆盖农业、法律、金融和阿育吠陀等领域，揭示了大型语言模型在低资源领域的显著性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基准测试主要为英语通用型，限制了其在印度本土和文化背景下的适用性，因此需要开发一个针对印度多领域的双语评估工具。

Method: BhashaBench V1 包含74,166个精心筛选的问题-答案对，涵盖英语和印地语，并包含90多个子领域和500多个主题，用于细粒度评估29种以上的大型语言模型。

Result: 评估结果显示模型在不同领域和语言中的表现存在显著差异，例如在法律领域表现较好（76.49%），而在阿育吠陀领域较差（59.74%），且英语内容的表现普遍优于印地语。

Conclusion: BhashaBench V1 提供了一个全面的数据集，支持评估大型语言模型在印度多样化知识领域的表现，所有代码和资源已公开以促进开放研究。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models(LLMs) has intensified the need
for domain and culture specific evaluation. Existing benchmarks are largely
Anglocentric and domain-agnostic, limiting their applicability to India-centric
contexts. To address this gap, we introduce BhashaBench V1, the first
domain-specific, multi-task, bilingual benchmark focusing on critical Indic
knowledge systems. BhashaBench V1 contains 74,166 meticulously curated
question-answer pairs, with 52,494 in English and 21,672 in Hindi, sourced from
authentic government and domain-specific exams. It spans four major domains:
Agriculture, Legal, Finance, and Ayurveda, comprising 90+ subdomains and
covering 500+ topics, enabling fine-grained evaluation. Evaluation of 29+ LLMs
reveals significant domain and language specific performance gaps, with
especially large disparities in low-resource domains. For instance, GPT-4o
achieves 76.49% overall accuracy in Legal but only 59.74% in Ayurveda. Models
consistently perform better on English content compared to Hindi across all
domains. Subdomain-level analysis shows that areas such as Cyber Law,
International Finance perform relatively well, while Panchakarma, Seed Science,
and Human Rights remain notably weak. BhashaBench V1 provides a comprehensive
dataset for evaluating large language models across India's diverse knowledge
domains. It enables assessment of models' ability to integrate domain-specific
knowledge with bilingual understanding. All code, benchmarks, and resources are
publicly available to support open research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM服务系统设计灵活性不足，难以适应日益复杂的应用需求，因此需要一种更高效、可扩展的架构。

Method: 提出LLM推理程序（LIPs）概念，允许用户运行时定制化；开发Symphony系统，作为LIPs的操作系统，支持系统调用和KV缓存虚拟化。

Result: Symphony系统通过LLM模型计算虚拟化和两级调度方案，提升了GPU利用率和应用扩展性。

Conclusion: Symphony架构为LLM应用提供了更高效和灵活的生态系统。

Abstract: Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for
text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex
LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving
system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this
problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to
customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload
parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We
describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which
functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model
computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file
system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling
scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and
extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展手语数据集的规模和多样性，为未来研究提供了一种高效的数据采集途径。

Abstract: Most existing sign language translation (SLT) datasets are limited in scale,
lack multilingual coverage, and are costly to curate due to their reliance on
expert annotation and controlled recording setup. Recently, Vision Language
Models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities as evaluators and real-time
assistants. Despite these advancements, their potential remains untapped in the
context of sign language dataset acquisition. To bridge this gap, we introduce
the first automated annotation and filtering framework that utilizes VLMs to
reduce reliance on manual effort while preserving data quality. Our method is
applied to TikTok videos across eight sign languages and to the already curated
YouTube-SL-25 dataset in German Sign Language for the purpose of additional
evaluation. Our VLM-based pipeline includes a face visibility detection, a sign
activity recognition, a text extraction from video content, and a judgment step
to validate alignment between video and text, implementing generic filtering,
annotation and validation steps. Using the resulting corpus, TikTok-SL-8, we
assess the performance of two off-the-shelf SLT models on our filtered dataset
for German and American Sign Languages, with the goal of establishing baselines
and evaluating the robustness of recent models on automatically extracted,
slightly noisy data. Our work enables scalable, weakly supervised pretraining
for SLT and facilitates data acquisition from social media.

### [102] [Implicature in Interaction: Understanding Implicature Improves Alignment in Human-LLM Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25426)
*Asutosh Hota,Jussi P. P. Jokinen*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了大语言模型（LLMs）在理解隐含意义（implicature）方面的能力及其对人类-AI交互（HAI）的影响，发现更大规模的模型更接近人类的理解，而隐含意义的运用显著提升了响应质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在探讨如何通过语言理论的运用（尤其是隐含意义）提升人类与AI交互的自然性和上下文相关性，从而解决对齐问题。

Method: 研究分析了LLMs对不同规模模型的隐含意义推理能力，并评估了基于隐含意义的提示对响应生成的影响。

Result: 更大规模的模型更接近人类对隐含意义的理解；基于隐含意义的提示显著提升了响应的相关性和质量，特别是对小规模模型效果更明显。67.6%的参与者更偏好隐含意义的提示。

Conclusion: 研究表明，语言理论（如隐含意义）可以优化HAI交互，使其更自然和上下文相关，为大语言模型的对齐问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) is positioning language
at the core of human-computer interaction (HCI). We argue that advancing HCI
requires attention to the linguistic foundations of interaction, particularly
implicature (meaning conveyed beyond explicit statements through shared
context) which is essential for human-AI (HAI) alignment. This study examines
LLMs' ability to infer user intent embedded in context-driven prompts and
whether understanding implicature improves response generation. Results show
that larger models approximate human interpretations more closely, while
smaller models struggle with implicature inference. Furthermore,
implicature-based prompts significantly enhance the perceived relevance and
quality of responses across models, with notable gains in smaller models.
Overall, 67.6% of participants preferred responses with implicature-embedded
prompts to literal ones, highlighting a clear preference for contextually
nuanced communication. Our work contributes to understanding how linguistic
theory can be used to address the alignment problem by making HAI interaction
more natural and contextually grounded.

TL;DR: RLMEval是一个针对神经定理证明和证明自动形式化的评估套件，专注于研究级数学，揭示了现有模型在实际挑战中的表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型在基准测试中表现优异，但在研究级数学的定理证明和自动形式化方面的实际应用仍然有限。

Method: 通过利用真实的Lean Blueprint形式化项目，RLMEval评估了613个定理，覆盖6个项目。

Result: 最佳模型的通过率仅为10.3%，表明现有模型在研究级数学任务中表现不佳。

Conclusion: RLMEval设计为一个具有挑战性的新基准，旨在推动形式化数学自动推理的进步。

Abstract: Despite impressive results on curated benchmarks, the practical impact of
large language models (LLMs) on research-level neural theorem proving and proof
autoformalization is still limited. We introduce RLMEval, an evaluation suite
for these tasks, focusing on research-level mathematics from real-world Lean
formalization projects. RLMEval targets the evaluation of neural theorem
proving and proof autoformalization on challenging research-level theorems by
leveraging real Lean Blueprint formalization projects. Our evaluation of
state-of-the-art models on RLMEval, comprising 613 theorems from 6 Lean
projects, reveals a significant gap: progress on existing benchmarks does not
readily translate to these more realistic settings, with the best model
achieving only a 10.3 % pass rate. RLMEval provides a new, challenging
benchmark designed to guide and accelerate progress in automated reasoning for
formal mathematics.

*Ali Sanaei,Ali Rajabzadeh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种框架，通过解释深度和自主性两个维度对LLM在定性研究中的应用进行分类，并提供设计建议，以在保持透明度和可靠性的同时利用LLM的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）在定性社会科学研究中面临解释偏差、可靠性低和可审计性弱等问题，需要一种方法来规范其使用。

Method: 引入两维框架（解释深度和自主性），分类LLM应用，并通过任务分解和选择性深度提升来优化设计。

Result: 研究发现，限制LLM的自主性并在必要时增加解释深度可以提高透明度和可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过合理设计，LLM可以在定性研究中发挥积极作用，但需控制自主性和选择性提升解释深度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized by researchers across
a wide range of domains, and qualitative social science is no exception;
however, this adoption faces persistent challenges, including interpretive
bias, low reliability, and weak auditability. We introduce a framework that
situates LLM usage along two dimensions, interpretive depth and autonomy,
thereby offering a straightforward way to classify LLM applications in
qualitative research and to derive practical design recommendations. We present
the state of the literature with respect to these two dimensions, based on all
published social science papers available on Web of Science that use LLMs as a
tool and not strictly as the subject of study. Rather than granting models
expansive freedom, our approach encourages researchers to decompose tasks into
manageable segments, much as they would when delegating work to capable
undergraduate research assistants. By maintaining low levels of autonomy and
selectively increasing interpretive depth only where warranted and under
supervision, one can plausibly reap the benefits of LLMs while preserving
transparency and reliability.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了基于文本的自动评估指标在手语翻译（SLT）中的局限性，比较了BLEU、ROUGE等传统指标与基于大型语言模型（LLM）的评估方法的效果，指出需要多模态评估框架以更全面评估SLT输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示当前基于文本的SLT评估指标的局限性，并提出多模态评估的必要性。

Method: 通过分析六种文本评估指标（BLEU、chrF、ROUGE、BLEURT）及两种LLM评估方法（G-Eval、GEMBA），在三种受控条件下（释义、幻觉输出、句子长度变化）评估其一致性和鲁棒性。

Result: 研究发现传统指标在语义等效捕捉上有缺陷，LLM评估器虽表现更好但易受释义偏差影响；BLEU对幻觉过于敏感，BLEURT和LLM则对细微情况较宽容。

Conclusion: 需开发超越文本的多模态评估框架以实现对SLT输出的更全面评估。

Abstract: Automatic evaluation metrics are crucial for advancing sign language
translation (SLT). Current SLT evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, are
only text-based, and it remains unclear to what extent text-based metrics can
reliably capture the quality of SLT outputs. To address this gap, we
investigate the limitations of text-based SLT evaluation metrics by analyzing
six metrics, including BLEU, chrF, and ROUGE, as well as BLEURT on the one
hand, and large language model (LLM)-based evaluators such as G-Eval and GEMBA
zero-shot direct assessment on the other hand. Specifically, we assess the
consistency and robustness of these metrics under three controlled conditions:
paraphrasing, hallucinations in model outputs, and variations in sentence
length. Our analysis highlights the limitations of lexical overlap metrics and
demonstrates that while LLM-based evaluators better capture semantic
equivalence often missed by conventional metrics, they can also exhibit bias
toward LLM-paraphrased translations. Moreover, although all metrics are able to
detect hallucinations, BLEU tends to be overly sensitive, whereas BLEURT and
LLM-based evaluators are comparatively lenient toward subtle cases. This
motivates the need for multimodal evaluation frameworks that extend beyond
text-based metrics to enable a more holistic assessment of SLT outputs.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合微调大语言模型（LLMs）和命名实体识别（NER）的流程，用于高效领域特定文本摘要和标记，解决了新兴小众语言和俚语带来的信息提取和监控困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速发展的新兴小众语言和俚语增加了自动化信息提取和法律监控的难度，需要一种高效解决方案。

Method: 利用LLaMA框架对LLMs进行微调，结合通用和定制领域数据集（特别是政治和安全领域），并通过BLEU和ROUGE指标评估模型效果。

Result: 研究发现，指令微调显著提升了模型在摘要和标记任务中的准确性，尤其是针对专业语料；LLaMA3-8B-Instruct模型在领域微调后表现优于中文训练的原生模型。

Conclusion: 该流程通过结合LLMs和NER，将非结构化文本转化为可操作的见解，适用于实时信息管理和安全操作，具有扩展性和适应性。

Abstract: This paper presents a pipeline integrating fine-tuned large language models
(LLMs) with named entity recognition (NER) for efficient domain-specific text
summarization and tagging. The authors address the challenge posed by rapidly
evolving sub-cultural languages and slang, which complicate automated
information extraction and law enforcement monitoring. By leveraging the LLaMA
Factory framework, the study fine-tunes LLMs on both generalpurpose and custom
domain-specific datasets, particularly in the political and security domains.
The models are evaluated using BLEU and ROUGE metrics, demonstrating that
instruction fine-tuning significantly enhances summarization and tagging
accuracy, especially for specialized corpora. Notably, the LLaMA3-8B-Instruct
model, despite its initial limitations in Chinese comprehension, outperforms
its Chinese-trained counterpart after domainspecific fine-tuning, suggesting
that underlying reasoning capabilities can transfer across languages. The
pipeline enables concise summaries and structured entity tagging, facilitating
rapid document categorization and distribution. This approach proves scalable
and adaptable for real-time applications, supporting efficient information
management and the ongoing need to capture emerging language trends. The
integration of LLMs and NER offers a robust solution for transforming
unstructured text into actionable insights, crucial for modern knowledge
management and security operations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对LLM人物模拟的评估局限于合成对话，缺乏系统框架和能力需求分析，因此需要更全面的评估工具。

Method: 引入TwinVoice基准，涵盖社交、人际和叙事三个维度，分解为六种基础能力进行评估。

Result: 实验显示，先进模型在人物模拟中表现中等，但在语法风格和记忆召回等方面仍不足，整体表现远低于人类基准。

Conclusion: TwinVoice为LLM人物模拟提供了系统评估方法，揭示当前模型的局限性，为未来改进指明方向。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are exhibiting emergent human-like abilities and
are increasingly envisioned as the foundation for simulating an individual's
communication style, behavioral tendencies, and personality traits. However,
current evaluations of LLM-based persona simulation remain limited: most rely
on synthetic dialogues, lack systematic frameworks, and lack analysis of the
capability requirement. To address these limitations, we introduce TwinVoice, a
comprehensive benchmark for assessing persona simulation across diverse
real-world contexts. TwinVoice encompasses three dimensions: Social Persona
(public social interactions), Interpersonal Persona (private dialogues), and
Narrative Persona (role-based expression). It further decomposes the evaluation
of LLM performance into six fundamental capabilities, including opinion
consistency, memory recall, logical reasoning, lexical fidelity, persona tone,
and syntactic style. Experimental results reveal that while advanced models
achieve moderate accuracy in persona simulation, they still fall short of
capabilities such as syntactic style and memory recall. Consequently, the
average performance achieved by LLMs remains considerably below the human
baseline.

TL;DR: 摘要介绍了一种名为FARSIQA的新型端到端波斯伊斯兰领域问答系统，旨在解决现有RAG系统在复杂多跳查询上的不足，并通过创新的FAIR-RAG架构实现了高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在自然语言处理中表现突出，但在宗教等高敏感领域仍存在幻觉和不忠实于权威来源的问题，尤其是波斯语穆斯林社区对准确性和可信度的需求迫切。

Method: FARSIQA基于FAIR-RAG架构，采用动态自校正过程，自适应分解复杂查询、评估证据充分性，并通过迭代生成子查询填补信息空白。

Result: 在伊斯兰PCQA基准测试中，FARSIQA表现出色，负面拒绝率达到97.0%（较基线提升40个百分点），答案正确率达74.3%。

Conclusion: FARSIQA为波斯伊斯兰问答树立了新标准，证实了迭代自适应架构在高敏感领域构建忠实可靠AI系统的重要性。

Abstract: The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized Natural
Language Processing, yet their application in high-stakes, specialized domains
like religious question answering is hindered by challenges like hallucination
and unfaithfulness to authoritative sources. This issue is particularly
critical for the Persian-speaking Muslim community, where accuracy and
trustworthiness are paramount. Existing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems, relying on simplistic single-pass pipelines, fall short on complex,
multi-hop queries requiring multi-step reasoning and evidence aggregation. To
address this gap, we introduce FARSIQA, a novel, end-to-end system for Faithful
Advanced Question Answering in the Persian Islamic domain. FARSIQA is built
upon our innovative FAIR-RAG architecture: a Faithful, Adaptive, Iterative
Refinement framework for RAG. FAIR-RAG employs a dynamic, self-correcting
process: it adaptively decomposes complex queries, assesses evidence
sufficiency, and enters an iterative loop to generate sub-queries,
progressively filling information gaps. Operating on a curated knowledge base
of over one million authoritative Islamic documents, FARSIQA demonstrates
superior performance. Rigorous evaluation on the challenging IslamicPCQA
benchmark shows state-of-the-art performance: the system achieves a remarkable
97.0% in Negative Rejection - a 40-point improvement over baselines - and a
high Answer Correctness score of 74.3%. Our work establishes a new standard for
Persian Islamic QA and validates that our iterative, adaptive architecture is
crucial for building faithful, reliable AI systems in sensitive domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管TTS在数学和编程等正式领域已被证明有效，但在法律等论证性领域的价值尚未充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用7种奖励模型家族，评估了在低预算条件下基于结果（Best-of-N）和基于过程（树搜索）的验证方法。

Result: 系统地分析了领域专业化、模型规模和监督类型（过程监督PRMs vs. 结果监督ORMs）对验证器效用的影响。

Conclusion: 研究表明，验证器的性能高度依赖于领域特性和监督类型，为法律领域的TTS应用提供了理论支持。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) techniques can improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) at the expense of additional computation and latency.
While TTS has proven effective in formal domains such as mathematics and
programming \citep{snell2024scaling, chen2024more}, its value in argumentative
domains such as law remains underexplored. We present an empirical study of
verifier-based TTS methods for legal multiple-choice QA (MCQA) across five
benchmarks. Using a family of 7 reward models, we evaluate both outcome-level
(Best-of-$N$) and process-level (tree search) verification under realistic
low-$N$ budgets. Our analysis systematically investigates how verifier utility
is affected by key properties such as domain specialization, model size, and
supervision type (process-supervised PRMs vs. outcome-only ORMs), even when
applied across different roles.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个评估语言模型推理效率的框架，发现在存在干扰信息时，当前模型的准确率显著下降且推理路径偏离最佳路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评价语言模型推理能力的方法多关注正确性，而忽视了效率这一关键因素。现实推理场景中常存在大量无关信息，高效推理需要能够识别并忽略这些干扰。

Method: 通过逻辑编程的视角评估模型推理效率，提出一种简单方法将语言模型生成的自然语言证明与逻辑程序找到的最短证明对齐，量化模型避免不必要推理的能力。

Result: 实验表明，当前语言模型在面对干扰信息时准确率显著下降，且生成的证明往往包含无关推理路径。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了语言模型推理效率的重要性，并提出了一种新的评估方法，揭示了模型在实际推理场景中的局限性。

Abstract: Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities,
yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect
of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of
the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference
requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for
assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming,
introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as
generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic
program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids
unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word
problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in
semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked
accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent
distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through
irrelevant inferences.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了EHR-Ins数据集、EHR-R1模型和EHR-Bench基准，显著提升了电子健康记录（EHR）分析的可靠性和临床相关性。EHR-R1模型在多阶段训练后，性能优于现有最佳模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录（EHR）的分析对临床决策至关重要，但目前大规模语言模型（LLM）在EHR分析中任务覆盖窄且缺乏推理能力。本文旨在弥补这一差距。

Method: 提出EHR-Ins数据集（30万推理案例和400万非推理案例）；开发EHR-R1模型（72B参数），通过领域适应、推理增强和强化学习多阶段训练；创建EHR-Bench基准。

Result: EHR-R1在实验中表现优于现有最佳商业和开源LLM（包括DeepSeek-V3和GPT-4o），在MIMIC-Bench上超过GPT-4o超过30分，EHRSHOT上的零样本AUROC提高10%。

Conclusion: EHR-Ins、EHR-R1和EHR-Bench显著提升了EHR分析的可靠性和临床相关性，为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) contain rich yet complex information, and
their automated analysis is critical for clinical decision-making. Despite
recent advances of large language models (LLMs) in clinical workflows, their
ability to analyze EHRs remains limited due to narrow task coverage and lack of
EHR-oriented reasoning capabilities. This paper aims to bridge the gap,
specifically, we present EHR-Ins, a large-scale, comprehensive EHR reasoning
instruction dataset, comprising 300k high-quality reasoning cases and 4M
non-reasoning cases across 42 distinct EHR tasks. Its core innovation is a
thinking-graph-driven framework that enables to generate high-quality reasoning
data at scale. Based on it, we develop EHR-R1, a series of reasoning-enhanced
LLMs with up to 72B parameters tailored for EHR analysis. Through a multi-stage
training paradigm, including domain adaptation, reasoning enhancement, and
reinforcement learning, EHR-R1 systematically acquires domain knowledge and
diverse reasoning capabilities, enabling accurate and robust EHR analysis.
Lastly, we introduce EHR-Bench, a new benchmark curated from MIMIC-IV, spanning
42 tasks, to comprehensively assess reasoning and prediction across EHR
scenarios. In experiments, we show that the resulting EHR-R1 consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art commercial and open-source LLMs (including
DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o), surpassing GPT-4o by over 30 points on MIMIC-Bench and
achieving a 10\% higher zero-shot AUROC on EHRSHOT. Collectively, EHR-Ins,
EHR-R1, and EHR-Bench have significantly advanced the development for more
reliable and clinically relevant EHR analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决视觉语言模型中理解和生成任务在数据、监督和策略优化上的异质性，需要一种统一的框架来平衡这些任务。

Method: PairUni将数据重组为理解-生成对，并通过GPT-o3增强单任务数据，同时设计了Pair-GPRO优化策略以学习相似对应的示例。

Result: PairUni在多种视觉语言模型中表现均衡，优于现有基线。

Conclusion: PairUni通过数据重组和策略优化，有效提升了视觉语言模型的性能和任务平衡能力。

Abstract: Unified vision-language models (UVLMs) must perform both understanding and
generation within a single architecture, but these tasks rely on heterogeneous
data and supervision, making it difficult to balance them during reinforcement
learning (RL). We propose PairUni, a unified framework that reorganizes data
into understanding-generation (UG) pairs and aligns optimization accordingly.
We first use GPT-o3 to augment single-task data, generating captions for
understanding samples and question-answer (QA) pairs for generation samples,
forming aligned pairs from the same instance. Additionally, for each generation
sample, we retrieve a semantically related understanding example to form a
retrieved pair, linking different but related data points. These paired
structures expose cross-task semantic correspondences and support consistent
policy learning. To leverage this structure, we present Pair-GPRO, a pair-aware
variant based on Group Relative Policy Optimization. It assigns a similarity
score to each pair to modulate the advantage, strengthening learning from
well-aligned examples and reducing task interference. We curate a high-quality
dataset of 16K UG pairs named PairUG for RL fine-tuning and evaluate PairUni on
the powerful Janus-Pro UVLMs. Our approach achieves balanced improvements on
various UVLMs, outperforming strong UVLM RL baselines. Code:

Motivation: 探索LLMs在结构化金融数据（如贷款违约预测）中的适用性，并与传统模型LightGBM进行对比。

Method: 使用零样本LLM分类器和LightGBM，通过SHAP分析特征归因，并评估LLM生成的自解释的可靠性。

Result: LLMs能识别关键风险指标，但其特征排名与LightGBM显著不同，自解释与SHAP实证不符。

Conclusion: LLMs在结构化金融风险评估中存在局限性，需结合可解释性审计和人工监督。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly explored as flexible
alternatives to classical machine learning models for classification tasks
through zero-shot prompting. However, their suitability for structured tabular
data remains underexplored, especially in high-stakes financial applications
such as financial risk assessment. This study conducts a systematic comparison
between zero-shot LLM-based classifiers and LightGBM, a state-of-the-art
gradient-boosting model, on a real-world loan default prediction task. We
evaluate their predictive performance, analyze feature attributions using SHAP,
and assess the reliability of LLM-generated self-explanations. While LLMs are
able to identify key financial risk indicators, their feature importance
rankings diverge notably from LightGBM, and their self-explanations often fail
to align with empirical SHAP attributions. These findings highlight the
limitations of LLMs as standalone models for structured financial risk
prediction and raise concerns about the trustworthiness of their self-generated
explanations. Our results underscore the need for explainability audits,
baseline comparisons with interpretable models, and human-in-the-loop oversight
when deploying LLMs in risk-sensitive financial environments.

TL;DR: 论文研究了如何通过说服性提示从未学习的大型语言模型（LLM）中恢复事实知识，并提出了SKeB框架来评估信息纠缠和知识激活模式。结果表明，说服性提示能显著提高事实知识回忆，且效果与模型大小成反比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管理敏感数据和纠正错误信息需要在大型语言模型中实现‘遗忘’，但目前缺乏有效的评估方法。研究旨在探索说服性提示是否能有效恢复被故意遗忘的事实知识。

Method: 结合ACT-R和Hebbian理论，提出SKeB框架，通过领域图建模信息纠缠并测试说服性提示对事实回忆的影响。开发了量化知识激活模式的指标。

Result: 说服性提示显著提升了事实知识回忆（24.5% vs 基线14.8%），且在较小模型中效果更显著（2.7B模型恢复128%，13B模型仅15%）。

Conclusion: SKeB框架为评估LLM的遗忘完整性、鲁棒性和行为提供了基础，显示说服性提示在恢复知识方面的潜力。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is crucial for managing sensitive
data and correcting misinformation, yet evaluating its effectiveness remains an
open problem. We investigate whether persuasive prompting can recall factual
knowledge from deliberately unlearned LLMs across models ranging from 2.7B to
13B parameters (OPT-2.7B, LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-2-13B). Drawing from
ACT-R and Hebbian theory (spreading activation theories), as well as
communication principles, we introduce Stimulus-Knowledge Entanglement-Behavior
Framework (SKeB), which models information entanglement via domain graphs and
tests whether factual recall in unlearned models is correlated with persuasive
framing. We develop entanglement metrics to quantify knowledge activation
patterns and evaluate factuality, non-factuality, and hallucination in outputs.
Our results show persuasive prompts substantially enhance factual knowledge
recall (14.8% baseline vs. 24.5% with authority framing), with effectiveness
inversely correlated to model size (128% recovery in 2.7B vs. 15% in 13B). SKeB
provides a foundation for assessing unlearning completeness, robustness, and
overall behavior in LLMs.

Motivation: 传统大型语言模型（LLM）依赖显式文本生成（如链式思维）进行推理，未能充分利用预训练数据。Ouro旨在将推理能力直接嵌入预训练阶段，以提高性能。

Method: 1）在潜在空间中进行迭代计算；2）通过学习深度分配的熵正则化目标；3）扩展到7.7T令牌的训练数据。1.4B和2.6B规模的模型被开发。

Result: Ouro模型性能优于12B规模的主流LLM，实验显示其优势源于知识操作能力而非知识容量。推理轨迹与输出更一致。

Conclusion: LoopLM展示了在推理时代的新扩展潜力，其优势在于知识操作能力，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Modern LLMs are trained to "think" primarily via explicit text generation,

under-leverages pre-training data. We present and open-source Ouro, named after
the recursive Ouroboros, a family of pre-trained Looped Language Models
(LoopLM) that instead build reasoning into the pre-training phase through (i)
iterative computation in latent space, (ii) an entropy-regularized objective
for learned depth allocation, and (iii) scaling to 7.7T tokens. Ouro 1.4B and
2.6B models enjoy superior performance that match the results of up to 12B SOTA
LLMs across a wide range of benchmarks. Through controlled experiments, we show
this advantage stems not from increased knowledge capacity, but from superior
knowledge manipulation capabilities. We also show that LoopLM yields reasoning
traces more aligned with final outputs than explicit CoT. We hope our results
show the potential of LoopLM as a novel scaling direction in the reasoning era.

Motivation: 虽然图表在研究中至关重要，但其创建复杂且耗时。现有图像生成模型难以生成结构清晰的图表，而LLMs生成的图表缺乏有效的评估方法。

Method: DiagramEval将图表建模为图结构，将文本元素作为节点，连接作为有向边，提出节点对齐和路径对齐两组指标评估图表质量。

Result: 实验证明了DiagramEval的有效性，首次定量评估了LLMs生成的图表质量，并揭示了LLM生成图表的特点。

Conclusion: DiagramEval填补了LLM生成图表评估方法的空白，其可解释性为研究提供了有价值的见解。

Abstract: Diagrams play a central role in research papers for conveying ideas, yet they
are often notoriously complex and labor-intensive to create. Although diagrams
are presented as images, standard image generative models struggle to produce
clear diagrams with well-defined structure. We argue that a promising direction
is to generate demonstration diagrams directly in textual form as SVGs, which
can leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs). However, due to
the complexity of components and the multimodal nature of diagrams,
sufficiently discriminative and explainable metrics for evaluating the quality
of LLM-generated diagrams remain lacking. In this paper, we propose
DiagramEval, a novel evaluation metric designed to assess demonstration
diagrams generated by LLMs. Specifically, DiagramEval conceptualizes diagrams
as graphs, treating text elements as nodes and their connections as directed
edges, and evaluates diagram quality using two new groups of metrics: node
alignment and path alignment. For the first time, we effectively evaluate
diagrams produced by state-of-the-art LLMs on recent research literature,
quantitatively demonstrating the validity of our metrics. Furthermore, we show
how the enhanced explainability of our proposed metrics offers valuable
insights into the characteristics of LLM-generated diagrams. Code:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在长文档问答中广泛应用，但现有后验归因方法在提取性QA中表现良好，而在多跳、抽象和半提取场景中表现不佳。

Method: 将后验归因问题重构为推理问题，生成答案分解单元并结合上下文；提出DecompTune方法，通过两阶段训练（SFT + GRPO）优化模型表现。

Result: DecompTune显著提升了归因质量，优于现有方法，并接近或超越前沿模型的性能。

Conclusion: DecompTune通过分解答案为推理步骤的方法，有效解决了复杂QA任务中的归因挑战。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for long-document question
answering, where reliable attribution to sources is critical for trust.
Existing post-hoc attribution methods work well for extractive QA but struggle
in multi-hop, abstractive, and semi-extractive settings, where answers
synthesize information across passages. To address these challenges, we argue
that post-hoc attribution can be reframed as a reasoning problem, where answers
are decomposed into constituent units, each tied to specific context. We first
show that prompting models to generate such decompositions alongside
attributions improves performance. Building on this, we introduce DecompTune, a
post-training method that teaches models to produce answer decompositions as
intermediate reasoning steps. We curate a diverse dataset of complex QA tasks,
annotated with decompositions by a strong LLM, and post-train Qwen-2.5 (7B and
14B) using a two-stage SFT + GRPO pipeline with task-specific curated rewards.
Across extensive experiments and ablations, DecompTune substantially improves
attribution quality, outperforming prior methods and matching or exceeding
state-of-the-art frontier models.

TL;DR: Gaperon是一套开源的法语-英语编码语言模型，旨在提高大规模模型训练的透明度和可重复性。研究发现数据过滤和污染对性能的影响，并提供了一套完整的研究工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动大规模语言模型训练的透明性和可重复性，同时探索数据过滤与泄漏对模型性能的影响。

Method: 训练了1.5B、8B和24B参数的模型，使用了2-4万亿token的数据集。数据集经过神经质量分类器过滤，同时研究了数据污染对模型的影响。

Result: 语言质量过滤提高了文本流畅性，但降低了基准测试分数；后期人为污染可以恢复基准分数，同时仅轻微损害生成质量。

Conclusion: Gaperon为多语言模型的开发提供了一个可重复的研究基础，强调了数据过滤、评估和安全之间的权衡。

Abstract: We release Gaperon, a fully open suite of French-English-coding language
models designed to advance transparency and reproducibility in large-scale
model training. The Gaperon family includes 1.5B, 8B, and 24B parameter models
trained on 2-4 trillion tokens, released with all elements of the training
pipeline: French and English datasets filtered with a neural quality
classifier, an efficient data curation and training framework, and hundreds of
intermediate checkpoints. Through this work, we study how data filtering and
contamination interact to shape both benchmark and generative performance. We
find that filtering for linguistic quality enhances text fluency and coherence
but yields subpar benchmark results, and that late deliberate contamination --
continuing training on data mixes that include test sets -- recovers
competitive scores while only reasonably harming generation quality. We discuss
how usual neural filtering can unintentionally amplify benchmark leakage. To
support further research, we also introduce harmless data poisoning during
pretraining, providing a realistic testbed for safety studies. By openly
releasing all models, datasets, code, and checkpoints, Gaperon establishes a
reproducible foundation for exploring the trade-offs between data curation,
evaluation, safety, and openness in multilingual language model development.
