### [1] [Diagnosing Bottlenecks in Data Visualization Understanding by Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21740)
*Alexa R. Tartaglini,Satchel Grant,Daniel Wurgaft,Christopher Potts,Judith E. Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究人员通过FUGU任务套件评估了三种主流视觉语言模型在数据可视化理解中的表现，发现模型在提取数据点坐标时存在错误，且错误主要源于视觉与语言模块的信息传递问题。提供正确坐标能改善部分任务表现，但对需统计关系的任务效果反而下降，表明现有模型架构在可视化理解上存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在数据可视化理解任务上表现不佳，但失败原因尚不明确。研究旨在通过开发FUGU任务套件，精确诊断模型错误的来源，以改进其性能。

Method: 研究人员设计了FUGU任务套件，评估三种广泛使用的视觉语言模型在数据可视化任务中的表现，并通过激活修补和线性探针技术追踪模型内部信息流，分析错误来源。

Result: 实验发现，模型在提取数据点坐标时容易出错，而这些错误多源于视觉与语言模块的信息传递。提供正确坐标能提升部分任务表现，但会降低需统计关系的任务效果。微调模型未能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: 当前视觉语言模型在数据可视化理解上存在架构性限制，特别是在视觉与语言模块的信息传递和复杂统计任务的处理上，需进一步改进。

Abstract: Data visualizations are vital components of many scientific articles and news
stories. Current vision-language models (VLMs) still struggle on basic data
visualization understanding tasks, but the causes of failure remain unclear.
Are VLM failures attributable to limitations in how visual information in the
data visualization is encoded, how information is transferred between the
vision and language modules, or how information is processed within the
language module? We developed FUGU, a suite of data visualization understanding
tasks, to precisely characterize potential sources of difficulty (e.g.,
extracting the position of data points, distances between them, and other
summary statistics). We used FUGU to investigate three widely used VLMs. To
diagnose the sources of errors produced by these models, we used activation
patching and linear probes to trace information flow through models across a
variety of prompting strategies. We found that some models fail to generate the
coordinates of individual data points correctly, and these initial errors often
lead to erroneous final responses. When these models are provided with the
correct coordinates, performance improves substantially. Moreover, even when
the model generates an incorrect response, the correct coordinates can be
successfully read out from the latent representations in the vision encoder,
suggesting that the source of these errors lies in the vision-language handoff.
We further found that while providing correct coordinates helps with tasks
involving one or a small number of data points, it generally worsens
performance for tasks that require extracting statistical relationships across
many data points. Fine-tuning models on FUGU also fails to yield ceiling
performance. These findings point to architectural constraints in current VLMs
that might pose significant challenges for reliable data visualization
understanding.

### [2] [Proportion and Perspective Control for Flow-Based Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21763)
*Julien Boudier,Hugo Caselles-Dupré*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文引入并评估了两种专门用于艺术控制的ControlNets，分别通过边界框和消失线实现对图像位置、比例和3D几何结构的控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像扩散模型虽能生成高保真图像，但对输出空间和几何结构的控制有限，因此提出两种ControlNets以增强控制能力。

Method: 提出了比例ControlNet（使用边界框控制对象位置和比例）和透视ControlNet（使用消失线控制场景3D几何结构），并通过数据管道进行训练。

Result: 实验表明，两种模块在控制方面均有效，但在复杂约束下存在局限性。

Conclusion: 研究成功实现了对图像空间和几何结构的增强控制，但需进一步优化以应对复杂约束。

Abstract: While modern text-to-image diffusion models generate high-fidelity images,
they offer limited control over the spatial and geometric structure of the
output. To address this, we introduce and evaluate two ControlNets specialized
for artistic control: (1) a proportion ControlNet that uses bounding boxes to
dictate the position and scale of objects, and (2) a perspective ControlNet
that employs vanishing lines to control the 3D geometry of the scene. We
support the training of these modules with data pipelines that leverage
vision-language models for annotation and specialized algorithms for
conditioning image synthesis. Our experiments demonstrate that both modules
provide effective control but exhibit limitations with complex constraints.
Both models are released on HuggingFace:

### [3] [H2OFlow: Grounding Human-Object Affordances with 3D Generative Models and Dense Diffused Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21769)
*Harry Zhang,Luca Carlone*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: H2OFlow是一种新型框架，通过合成数据学习3D人-物交互（HOI）的全面功能（接触、方向和空间占用），无需人工标注，并在真实世界中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖人工标注数据且局限于接触分析，忽略方向和空间占用等关键交互特征。

Method: H2OFlow利用3D生成模型的合成数据，通过点云上的密集扩散过程学习3D流表示。

Result: 实验表明，H2OFlow能有效推广到真实对象，并超越依赖人工标注或网格表示的方法。

Conclusion: H2OFlow提供了一种无需人工标注的全面3D HOI功能学习方法，优于现有技术。

Abstract: Understanding how humans interact with the surrounding environment, and
specifically reasoning about object interactions and affordances, is a critical
challenge in computer vision, robotics, and AI. Current approaches often depend
on labor-intensive, hand-labeled datasets capturing real-world or simulated
human-object interaction (HOI) tasks, which are costly and time-consuming to
produce. Furthermore, most existing methods for 3D affordance understanding are
limited to contact-based analysis, neglecting other essential aspects of
human-object interactions, such as orientation (\eg, humans might have a
preferential orientation with respect certain objects, such as a TV) and
spatial occupancy (\eg, humans are more likely to occupy certain regions around
an object, like the front of a microwave rather than its back). To address
these limitations, we introduce \emph{H2OFlow}, a novel framework that
comprehensively learns 3D HOI affordances -- encompassing contact, orientation,
and spatial occupancy -- using only synthetic data generated from 3D generative
models. H2OFlow employs a dense 3D-flow-based representation, learned through a
dense diffusion process operating on point clouds. This learned flow enables
the discovery of rich 3D affordances without the need for human annotations.
Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate that
H2OFlow generalizes effectively to real-world objects and surpasses prior
methods that rely on manual annotations or mesh-based representations in
modeling 3D affordance.

### [5] [Face-MakeUpV2: Facial Consistency Learning for Controllable Text-to-Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21775)
*Dawei Dai,Yinxiu Zhou,Chenghang Li,Guolai Jiang,Chengfang Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Face-MakeUpV2是一种面部图像生成模型，通过构建大规模数据集和引入双重面部信息注入通道，解决了现有文本生成图像模型中面部属性泄漏和物理一致性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本生成图像模型在响应局部语义指令时，常面临面部属性泄漏和物理一致性不足的问题。本研究旨在通过Face-MakeUpV2模型，保持面部ID和物理特征的参考图像一致性。

Method: 1) 构建大规模数据集FaceCaptionMask-1M；2) 采用通用文本生成图像预训练模型作为主干，引入3D面部渲染通道和全局面部特征通道；3) 设计语义对齐和感知损失两个优化目标。

Result: 实验表明，Face-MakeUpV2在保持面部ID和物理一致性方面表现最佳，突出了其在可靠可控的面部编辑中的实际潜力。

Conclusion: Face-MakeUpV2为解决面部图像生成中的属性泄漏和物理一致性问题提供了有效方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: In facial image generation, current text-to-image models often suffer from
facial attribute leakage and insufficient physical consistency when responding
to local semantic instructions. In this study, we propose Face-MakeUpV2, a
facial image generation model that aims to maintain the consistency of face ID
and physical characteristics with the reference image. First, we constructed a
large-scale dataset FaceCaptionMask-1M comprising approximately one million
image-text-masks pairs that provide precise spatial supervision for the local
semantic instructions. Second, we employed a general text-to-image pretrained
model as the backbone and introduced two complementary facial information
injection channels: a 3D facial rendering channel to incorporate the physical
characteristics of the image and a global facial feature channel. Third, we
formulated two optimization objectives for the supervised learning of our
model: semantic alignment in the model's embedding space to mitigate the
attribute leakage problem and perceptual loss on facial images to preserve ID
consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our Face-MakeUpV2 achieves
best overall performance in terms of preserving face ID and maintaining
physical consistency of the reference images. These results highlight the
practical potential of Face-MakeUpV2 for reliable and controllable facial
editing in diverse applications.

### [6] [Ageing Drift in Binary Face Templates: A Bits-per-Decade Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21778)
*Abdelilah Ganmati,Karim Afdel,Lahcen Koutti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了紧凑二进制人脸模板的纵向稳定性，量化了老化漂移单位为每十年比特。使用PCA-ITQ压缩现代人脸CNN的浮点嵌入为64位和128位编码，并通过线性模型分析年龄差距与汉明距离的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨人脸识别系统中紧凑二进制模板的老化漂移问题，以确保系统的长期稳定性。

Method: 采用PCA-ITQ压缩人脸CNN的浮点嵌入生成64位和128位编码，对AgeDB数据库中每个身份的真实配对拟合线性模型，分析汉明距离与绝对年龄差距的关系。

Result: 566个身份的分析显示，中位数漂移率为64位模板每十年1.357比特，128位模板每十年2.571比特，漂移趋势显著且系统性。短编码在固定决策阈值下更具年龄稳定性。

Conclusion: 研究表明人脸模板存在系统性老化漂移，短编码更稳定，并提出了简单的缓解措施如定期重新注册和针对性位校验。

Abstract: We study the longitudinal stability of compact binary face templates and
quantify ageing drift directly in bits per decade. Float embeddings from a
modern face CNN are compressed with PCA-ITQ into 64- and 128-bit codes. For
each identity in AgeDB with at least three distinct ages, we form all genuine
pairs and fit a per-identity linear model of Hamming distance versus absolute
age gap. Across 566 identities, the median slope is 1.357 bits per decade for
64-bit templates and 2.571 bits per decade for 128-bit templates, with tight
non-parametric 95 percent bootstrap confidence intervals. The distributions are
predominantly positive, indicating a small but systematic increase in
intra-class distance over time. Because drift scales with code length, shorter
codes are inherently more age-stable at a fixed decision threshold. We connect
these slopes to operating characteristics by reporting EER and TPR at FAR = 1
percent in three age bins. We discuss implications for smart-card and
match-on-card deployments, including simple mitigations such as periodic
re-enrolment and targeted parity on empirically unstable bit positions. Code
and CSV artifacts are provided to support reproducibility.

### [7] [EdgeSync: Accelerating Edge-Model Updates for Data Drift through Adaptive Continuous Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21781)
*Runchu Donga,Peng Zhao,Guiqin Wang,Nan Qi,Jie Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeSync通过高效的边缘模型更新方法，解决了实时视频分析系统中数据特征分布变化导致的模型准确性下降问题，提高了模型更新的时效性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时视频分析系统中，由于光照和天气等因素导致数据特征分布变化，轻量级模型的准确性会下降。现有方法存在计算密集和模型更新不及时的问题，需要改进。

Method: EdgeSync结合及时性和推理结果优化了样本筛选，确保训练样本与当前视频内容更相关；同时引入动态训练管理模块，优化模型更新的时机和顺序。

Result: 在多样化和复杂的数据集上评估显示，EdgeSync的准确性比现有方法提高约3.4%，比传统方法提高约10%。

Conclusion: EdgeSync通过优化样本筛选和动态管理，显著提升了实时视频分析系统的模型更新效率和准确性。

Abstract: Real-time video analytics systems typically deploy lightweight models on edge
devices to reduce latency. However, the distribution of data features may
change over time due to various factors such as changing lighting and weather
conditions, leading to decreased model accuracy. Recent frameworks try to
address this issue by leveraging remote servers to continuously train and adapt
lightweight edge models using more complex models in the cloud. Despite these
advancements, existing methods face two key challenges: first, the retraining
process is compute-intensive, causing significant delays in model updates;
second, the new model may not align well with the evolving data distribution of
the current video stream. To address these challenges, we introduce EdgeSync,
an efficient edge-model updating approach that enhances sample filtering by
incorporating timeliness and inference results, thus ensuring training samples
are more relevant to the current video content while reducing update delays.
Additionally, EdgeSync features a dynamic training management module that
optimizes the timing and sequencing of model updates to improve their
timeliness. Evaluations on diverse and complex real-world datasets demonstrate
that EdgeSync improves accuracy by approximately 3.4% compared to existing
methods and by about 10% compared to traditional approaches.

### [8] [Promptable Fire Segmentation: Unleashing SAM2's Potential for Real-Time Mobile Deployment with Strategic Bounding Box Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21782)
*Emmanuel U. Ugwu,Zhang Xinming*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文评估了SAM2变体在火焰分割中的表现，重点研究了边界框提示策略的效果，发现Box+MP方法在Khan数据集上表现最佳。轻量级变体如TinySAM和MobileSAM更适合边缘计算场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 火焰分割因火焰边界不规则、边缘半透明和强度高度变化而面临挑战，SAM2的跨领域泛化能力在此任务中的有效性尚未被充分探索。

Method: 系统评估了四种SAM2.1变体和两种移动优化变体在三种火焰数据集上的表现，采用七种提示策略（自动、SP、SP+SN、MP、Box及混合策略）。

Result: 边界框提示策略表现最优，尤其是Box+MP在Khan数据集上达到最高IoU（0.64）和Dice系数（0.75）。轻量级变体显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 研究为火焰监测系统中可提示分割模型的部署提供了重要指导，并为未来领域特定SAM应用研究设立了基准。

Abstract: Fire segmentation remains a critical challenge in computer vision due to
flames' irregular boundaries, translucent edges, and highly variable
intensities. While the Segment Anything Models (SAM and SAM2) have demonstrated
impressive cross-domain generalization capabilities, their effectiveness in
fire segmentation -- particularly under mobile deployment constraints --
remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive
evaluation of SAM2 variants for fire segmentation, focusing on bounding box
prompting strategies to enhance deployment feasibility. We systematically
evaluate four SAM2.1 variants (tiny, small, base_plus, large) alongside
mobile-oriented variants (TinySAM, MobileSAM) across three fire datasets using
multiple prompting strategies: automatic, single positive point (SP), single
positive point + single negative point (SP+SN), multiple positive points (MP),
bounding box (Box), and hybrid variants (Box+SP and Box+MP). Our experimental
results demonstrate that bounding box prompts consistently outperform automatic
and single point-based approaches, with Box+MP achieving the highest mean IoU
(0.64) and Dice coefficient (0.75) on the Khan dataset. Lightweight variants
such as TinySAM and MobileSAM further reduce memory and computational costs,
making them more suitable for latency-tolerant edge scenarios. Overall, this
work provides critical insights for deploying promptable segmentation models in
fire monitoring systems and establishes benchmarks for future research in
domain-specific SAM applications. Code is available at:

### [9] [Noise Aggregation Analysis Driven by Small-Noise Injection: Efficient Membership Inference for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21783)
*Guo Li,Yuyang Yu,Xuemiao Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对扩散模型的高效成员推理攻击方法，通过注入轻微噪声并分析噪声分布的聚合程度来区分训练集和非训练集样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在高质量图像生成方面表现出色，但广泛使用可能带来隐私风险，尤其是成员推理攻击的威胁。

Method: 在测试图像中注入轻微噪声，通过分析模型预测的噪声分布的聚合程度来判断样本是否属于训练集。

Result: 该方法在多个数据集上表现优异，并在大规模文本到图像扩散模型中实现了更高的攻击成功率（ASR）和曲线下面积（AUC）。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且可扩展，能够有效识别扩散模型中的训练集样本，为隐私保护提供了新的研究方向。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated powerful performance in generating
high-quality images. A typical example is text-to-image generator like Stable
Diffusion. However, their widespread use also poses potential privacy risks. A
key concern is membership inference attacks, which attempt to determine whether
a particular data sample was used in the model training process. We propose an
efficient membership inference attack method against diffusion models. This
method is based on the injection of slight noise and the evaluation of the
aggregation degree of the noise distribution. The intuition is that the noise
prediction patterns of diffusion models for training set samples and
non-training set samples exhibit distinguishable differences.Specifically, we
suppose that member images exhibit higher aggregation of predicted noise around
a certain time step of the diffusion process. In contrast, the predicted noises
of non-member images exhibit a more discrete characteristic around the certain
time step. Compared with other existing methods, our proposed method requires
fewer visits to the target diffusion model. We inject slight noise into the
image under test and then determine its membership by analyzing the aggregation
degree of the noise distribution predicted by the model. Empirical findings
indicate that our method achieves superior performance across multiple
datasets. At the same time, our method can also show better attack effects in
ASR and AUC when facing large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, proving the
scalability of our method.

### [10] [Multi-Agent Pose Uncertainty: A Differentiable Rendering Cramér-Rao Bound](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21785)
*Arun Muthukkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于可微分渲染器的闭式下界方法，用于量化相机姿态估计的不确定性，并通过线性化图像形成过程扩展到多智能体场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管姿态估计在计算机视觉和机器人学中有广泛应用，但当前方法在密集或学习模型下缺乏严格的姿态不确定性量化。

Method: 通过将可微分渲染器视为测量函数，推导相机姿态估计协方差的闭式下界，并在流形上线性化图像形成过程，得到渲染感知的Cramér-Rao界。

Result: 该方法继承了传统捆绑调整不确定性的连续性，并自然扩展到多智能体场景，通过融合多摄像机的Fisher信息实现。

Conclusion: 该统计框架为合作感知和新视角合成等任务提供了下游应用的可能，且无需显式关键点对应。

Abstract: Pose estimation is essential for many applications within computer vision and
robotics. Despite its uses, few works provide rigorous uncertainty
quantification for poses under dense or learned models. We derive a closed-form
lower bound on the covariance of camera pose estimates by treating a
differentiable renderer as a measurement function. Linearizing image formation
with respect to a small pose perturbation on the manifold yields a render-aware
Cram\'er-Rao bound. Our approach reduces to classical bundle-adjustment
uncertainty, ensuring continuity with vision theory. It also naturally extends
to multi-agent settings by fusing Fisher information across cameras. Our
statistical formulation has downstream applications for tasks such as
cooperative perception and novel view synthesis without requiring explicit
keypoint correspondences.

### [11] [EventFormer: A Node-graph Hierarchical Attention Transformer for Action-centric Video Event Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21786)
*Qile Su,Shoutai Zhu,Shuai Zhang,Baoyu Liang,Chao Tong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了AVEP任务，旨在通过视频预测后续事件，并引入了包含35K标注视频和178K视频片段的大规模数据集。与传统视频预测任务不同，AVEP更注重复杂逻辑和语义信息。作者提出的EventFormer模型在实验中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频中的事件预测在现实中非常重要，但现有研究主要集中在脚本事件上，缺乏对视频事件的关注。因此，作者提出AVEP任务，以填补这一研究空白。

Method: 作者构建了一个结构化数据集，并提出了EventFormer模型，该模型基于节点-图层次注意力机制，能够捕捉事件与其参数之间的关系以及参数间的共指关系。

Result: 实验表明，EventFormer优于多种SOTA视频预测模型和LVLMs，验证了数据集和任务的价值。

Conclusion: AVEP任务及其相关数据集和EventFormer模型为视频事件预测提供了新的研究方向和实践工具。

Abstract: Script event induction, which aims to predict the subsequent event based on
the context, is a challenging task in NLP, achieving remarkable success in
practical applications. However, human events are mostly recorded and presented
in the form of videos rather than scripts, yet there is a lack of related
research in the realm of vision. To address this problem, we introduce AVEP
(Action-centric Video Event Prediction), a task that distinguishes itself from
existing video prediction tasks through its incorporation of more complex logic
and richer semantic information. We present a large structured dataset, which
consists of about $35K$ annotated videos and more than $178K$ video clips of
event, built upon existing video event datasets to support this task. The
dataset offers more fine-grained annotations, where the atomic unit is
represented as a multimodal event argument node, providing better structured
representations of video events. Due to the complexity of event structures,
traditional visual models that take patches or frames as input are not
well-suited for AVEP. We propose EventFormer, a node-graph hierarchical
attention based video event prediction model, which can capture both the
relationships between events and their arguments and the coreferencial
relationships between arguments. We conducted experiments using several SOTA
video prediction models as well as LVLMs on AVEP, demonstrating both the
complexity of the task and the value of the dataset. Our approach outperforms
all these video prediction models. We will release the dataset and code for
replicating the experiments and annotations.

### [12] [Mismatch reconstruction theory for unknown measurement matrix in imaging through multimode fiber bending](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21787)
*Le Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的不匹配重建理论，用于解决测量矩阵未知时的图像重建问题，通过设计校准算法构建新测量矩阵，并证明了其在低噪声下的有效性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模光纤成像需要严格的测量值与测量矩阵匹配以实现图像重建，但实际中测量矩阵常因未知系统配置或光纤弯曲后难以实时对齐而无法获取，导致传统算法失效。

Method: 提出了不匹配方程，设计了匹配和校准解决方案算法以构建新测量矩阵，并在附录中详细证明了这些方程和算法。

Result: 实验显示，低噪声下构建的矩阵可用于传统算法中的匹配对并成功重建图像；分析了噪声、计算精度和正交性对重建性能的影响，算法具有一定鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 讨论了该理论的局限性和潜在应用，同时开源了代码。

Abstract: Multimode fiber imaging requires strict matching between measurement value
and measurement matrix to achieve image reconstruction. However, in practical
applications, the measurement matrix often cannot be obtained due to unknown
system configuration or difficulty in real-time alignment after arbitrary fiber
bending, resulting in the failure of traditional reconstruction algorithms.
This paper presents a novel mismatch reconstruction theory for solving the
problem of image reconstruction when measurement matrix is unknown. We first
propose mismatch equation and design matched and calibration solution
algorithms to construct a new measurement matrix. In addition, we also provide
a detailed proof of these equations and algorithms in the appendix. The
experimental results show that under low noise levels, constructed matrix can
be used for matched pair in traditional reconstruction algorithms, and
reconstruct the original image successfully. Then, we analyze the impact of
noise, computational precision and orthogonality on reconstruction performance.
The results show that proposed algorithms have a certain degree of robustness.
Finally, we discuss the limitations and potential applications of this theory.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Data fusion is an essential task in various domains, enabling the integration
of multi-source information to enhance data quality and insights. One key
application is in satellite remote sensing, where fusing multi-sensor
observations can improve spatial and temporal resolution. In this study, we
explore the design space of diffusion and flow models for data fusion, focusing
on the integration of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational
Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite
(VIIRS) nighttime lights data. Our approach leverages a diverse set of 2D
image-to-image generative models, including UNET, diffusion, and flow modeling
architectures. We evaluate the effectiveness of these architectures in
satellite remote sensing data fusion, identifying diffusion models based on
UNet as particularly adept at preserving fine-grained spatial details and
generating high-fidelity fused images. We also provide guidance on the
selection of noise schedulers in diffusion-based models, highlighting the
trade-offs between iterative solvers for faster inference and discrete
schedulers for higher-quality reconstructions. Additionally, we explore
quantization techniques to optimize memory efficiency and computational cost
without compromising performance. Our findings offer practical insights into
selecting the most effective diffusion and flow model architectures for data
fusion tasks, particularly in remote sensing applications, and provide
recommendations for leveraging noise scheduling strategies to enhance fusion
quality.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (IAD) increasingly benefits from integrating 2D
and 3D data, but robust cross-modal fusion remains challenging. We propose a
novel unsupervised framework, Multi-Modal Attention-Driven Fusion Restoration
(MAFR), which synthesises a unified latent space from RGB images and point
clouds using a shared fusion encoder, followed by attention-guided,
modality-specific decoders. Anomalies are localised by measuring reconstruction
errors between input features and their restored counterparts. Evaluations on
the MVTec 3D-AD and Eyecandies benchmarks demonstrate that MAFR achieves
state-of-the-art results, with a mean I-AUROC of 0.972 and 0.901, respectively.
The framework also exhibits strong performance in few-shot learning settings,
and ablation studies confirm the critical roles of the fusion architecture and
composite loss. MAFR offers a principled approach for fusing visual and
geometric information, advancing the robustness and accuracy of industrial
anomaly detection. Code is available at https://github.com/adabrh/MAFR

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become essential backbones of modern
multimodal intelligence, yet their outputs remain prone to
hallucination-plausible text misaligned with visual inputs. Existing alignment
approaches often rely on expensive fine-tuning with annotated preference data
or sequence-level inference strategies that provide only coarse, delayed
feedback. To overcome these limitations, we present TITA (Token-level
Inference-Time Alignment), a lightweight framework that freezes the base VLM
and instead trains a reward model to approximate its distribution. During
inference, implicit preference signals are extracted as log-probability ratios
between the reward model and the target VLM, yielding dense autoregressive
feedback. This formulation can be viewed as an inference-time variant of Direct
Preference Optimization (DPO), providing token-level corrective signals without
retraining the backbone. Extensive evaluations on LLaVA-1.5-7B and 13B show
consistent gains across 12 benchmarks, with improvements of 8.6% on MMVet and
6.7% on POPE, indicating stronger general understanding and reduced
hallucinations. Additional experiments on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and DeepSeek-VL2-27.5B
show comparable gains, especially in hallucination reduction and VQA accuracy,
while incurring negligible inference overhead.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of time series foundation models (TSFMs) has been
propelled by migrating architectures from language models. While existing TSFMs
demonstrate impressive performance, their direct adoption of cross-domain
architectures constrains effective capture of multiscale temporal dependencies
inherent to time series data. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced
during zero-shot transfer across datasets with divergent underlying patterns
and sampling strategies. To address these challenges, we propose Hierarchical
Interleaved Block Attention (HIBA) which employs hierarchical inter- and
intra-block sparse attention to effectively capture multi-scale dependencies.
Intra-block attention facilitates local information exchange, and inter-block
attention operates across blocks to capture global temporal pattern interaction
and dynamic evolution. Leveraging the HIBA architecture, we introduce Xihe, a
scalable TSFM family spanning from an ultra-efficient 9.5M parameter
configuration to high-capacity 1.5B variant. Evaluated on the comprehensive
GIFT-Eval benchmark, our most compact Xihe-tiny model (9.5M) surpasses the
majority of contemporary TSFMs, demonstrating remarkable parameter efficiency.
More impressively, Xihe-max (1.5B) establishes new state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance, surpassing previous best results by a substantial margin. This
consistent performance excellence across the entire parameter spectrum provides
compelling evidence for the exceptional generalization capabilities and
architectural superiority of HIBA.

Motivation: 旨在通过AI辅助标注提升视频标注任务的效率和质量，同时评估其对标注者和标注流程的影响。

Method: 采用Label Studio和AI驱动的零样本预标注方案，设计了一个基于UCF-Crime数据集的测试，区分视频中的正常与异常活动。

Result: 实验结果显示，AI预标注将70%标注者的标注时间减少35%，同时保持了标注质量的一致性。此外，标注者使用工具后产生的标注更具一致性且更符合视频帧的自然聚类。

Conclusion: AI辅助的预标注能够显著优化视频标注流程，提高效率和标注者协作的一致性。

Abstract: We explore the enhancement of Human-in-the-Loop video annotation by
integrating automatic capabilities to ease the task for annotators and assess
their performance. The research delves into the practical implications of the
annotation processes, the integration of AI components, and the evaluation of
its outcomes. We analyze their impact on efficiency, accuracy, and overall
annotation quality. Focusing on the Human-in-the-Loop for video annotation
tasks, we implemented a single-iteration scheme using Label Studio and
AI-powered zero-shot pre-annotations. Using this framework, we designed a test
based on the annotation of the UCF-Crime dataset to discriminate between normal
and abnormal activities in video footage. Our results evidence how automatic
AI-based pre-annotation can streamline the video annotation workflow,
empowering human annotators and optimizing the overall pipeline. Using the
pre-annotated data, we observed a 35% reduction in the annotation time for 70%
of the annotators with similar quality annotations, compared to the traditional
manual annotation task. Results are consistent with asset duration and
complexity. We also observed that while annotators rapidly learned to use the
tool, the produced annotations are more coherent among annotators and better
match the natural clustering of the video frames.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 膝关节骨关节炎的诊断在放射线影像中具有挑战性，因为标准深度学习模型难以捕捉细微的形态学细节。

Method: 采用多模态框架，结合解剖结构（基于Segment Anything Model的分割生成的形态图）与放射特征，通过互信息最大化实现几何图嵌入与放射特征的对齐。

Result: 在Osteoarthritis Initiative数据集上，该方法比单模态基线提高了10%的准确率（接近80%），并比现有最优方法高出8%的准确率和11%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 实验结果表明，将解剖结构纳入放射分析对准确评估膝关节骨关节炎的严重程度至关重要。

Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) diagnosis from radiographs remains challenging due
to the subtle morphological details that standard deep learning models struggle
to capture effectively. We propose a novel multimodal framework that combines
anatomical structure with radiographic features by integrating a morphological
graph representation - derived from Segment Anything Model (SAM) segmentations
- with a vision encoder. Our approach enforces alignment between
geometry-informed graph embeddings and radiographic features through mutual
information maximization, significantly improving KOA classification accuracy.
By constructing graphs from anatomical features, we introduce explicit
morphological priors that mirror clinical assessment criteria, enriching the
feature space and enhancing the model's inductive bias. Experiments on the
Osteoarthritis Initiative dataset demonstrate that our approach surpasses
single-modality baselines by up to 10\% in accuracy (reaching nearly 80\%),
while outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods by 8\% in accuracy and
11\% in F1 score. These results underscore the critical importance of
incorporating anatomical structure into radiographic analysis for accurate KOA
severity grading.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在有限步降噪条件下，如何通过并行采样器的协作提升生成图像的质量。

Method: 通过两个并行采样器在连续时间步进行降噪，并将信息整合到潜在图像中。

Result: 实验表明该方法能提升样本质量，但简单的信息整合会降低质量，且增加更多采样器未必有进一步改善。

Conclusion: 该方法简单有效，适用于不同扩散模型，为有限步降噪提供了一种实用解决方案。

Abstract: We consider the situation where we have a limited number of denoising steps,
i.e., of evaluations of a diffusion model. We show that two parallel processors
or samplers under such limitation can improve the quality of the sampled image.
Particularly, the two samplers make denoising steps at successive times, and
their information is appropriately integrated in the latent image. Remarkably,
our method is simple both conceptually and to implement: it is plug-&-play,
model agnostic, and does not require any additional fine-tuning or external
models. We test our method with both automated and human evaluations for
different diffusion models. We also show that a naive integration of the
information from the two samplers lowers sample quality. Finally, we find that
adding more parallel samplers does not necessarily improve sample quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于CLIP的文本-视频检索训练框架FDA-CLIP，通过动态区域掩码提升动态视频特征并抑制静态冗余特征，解决了现有方法在跨模态对齐和数据依赖上的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本-视频检索方法依赖大规模标注数据且存在模态差异问题，同时缺乏对动态特征的增强和对静态冗余特征的有效抑制。

Method: 提出FDA-CLIP框架，利用帧差异生成动态区域掩码并输入Alpha-CLIP，引导模型关注动态区域并抑制静态背景冗余。

Result: 实验表明，帧差异引导的视频语义编码可有效平衡检索效率和准确率。

Conclusion: FDA-CLIP为视频-文本对齐提供了一种高效简洁的解决方案。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video data, text-video retrieval technology has
become increasingly important in numerous application scenarios such as
recommendation and search. Early text-video retrieval methods suffer from two
critical drawbacks: first, they heavily rely on large-scale annotated
video-text pairs, leading to high data acquisition costs; second, there is a
significant modal gap between video and text features, which limits cross-modal
alignment accuracy. With the development of vision-language model, adapting
CLIP to video tasks has attracted great attention. However, existing adaptation
methods generally lack enhancement for dynamic video features and fail to
effectively suppress static redundant features. To address this issue, this
paper proposes FDA-CLIP (Frame Difference Alpha-CLIP), which is a concise
CLIP-based training framework for text-video alignment. Specifically, the
method uses frame differences to generate dynamic region masks, which are input
into Alpha-CLIP as an additional Alpha channel. This proactively guides the
model to focus on semantically critical dynamic regions while suppressing
static background redundancy. Experiments demonstrate that frame
difference-guided video semantic encoding can effectively balance retrieval
efficiency and accuracy.

Result: MPCC任务和Prior Sampling方法提升了模型性能及其在OOD和跨任务场景中的泛化推理能力。

Conclusion: MPCC任务和评估方法为多模态推理模型的泛化能力提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in reasoning models have markedly advanced the reasoning
capabilities of large language models, particularly via training on tasks with
verifiable rewards. Yet, a significant gap persists in their adaptation to real
world multimodal scenarios, most notably, vision language tasks, due to a heavy
focus on single modal language settings. While efforts to transplant
reinforcement learning techniques from NLP to VLMs have emerged, these
approaches often remain confined to perception centric tasks or reduce images
to textual summaries, failing to fully exploit visual context and commonsense
knowledge, ultimately constraining the generalization of reasoning capabilities
across diverse multimodal environments. To address this limitation, we
introduce a novel fine tuning task, Masked Prediction via Context and
Commonsense, which forces models to integrate visual context and commonsense
reasoning by reconstructing semantically meaningful content from occluded
images, thereby laying the foundation for generalized reasoning. To
systematically evaluate the model performance in generalized reasoning, we
developed a specialized evaluation benchmark, MPCC Eval, and employed various
fine tuning strategies to guide reasoning. Among these, we introduced an
innovative training method, Reinforcement Fine tuning with Prior Sampling,
which not only enhances model performance but also improves its generalized
reasoning capabilities in OOD and cross task scenarios.

Motivation: 数据标注的高成本促使研究在数据有限的情况下训练深度学习模型，现有方法未能平衡跨域迁移和跨类别泛化，因此需要DAZSL。

Method: 提出SRE-CLIP框架，结合语义关系结构损失和跨模态对齐保留策略，优化CLIP在DAZSL中的应用。

Result: 在I2AwA和I2WebV基准测试中达到最优性能，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SRE-CLIP是首个基于CLIP的DAZSL方法，解决了跨类别知识转移和跨模态对齐的问题，取得了显著成果。

Abstract: The high cost of data annotation has spurred research on training deep
learning models in data-limited scenarios. Existing paradigms, however, fail to
balance cross-domain transfer and cross-category generalization, giving rise to
the demand for Domain-Adaptive Zero-Shot Learning (DAZSL). Although
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have inherent advantages in the DAZSL
field, current studies do not fully exploit their potential. Applying CLIP to
DAZSL faces two core challenges: inefficient cross-category knowledge transfer
due to the lack of semantic relation guidance, and degraded cross-modal
alignment during target domain fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose
a Semantic Relation-Enhanced CLIP (SRE-CLIP) Adapter framework, integrating a
Semantic Relation Structure Loss and a Cross-Modal Alignment Retention
Strategy. As the first CLIP-based DAZSL method, SRE-CLIP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the I2AwA and I2WebV benchmarks, significantly
outperforming existing approaches.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过知识蒸馏将动作描述融入强化学习是一种有效的方法，既实现了系统的可解释性，又不牺牲性能。

Abstract: The field of multimodal robot navigation in indoor environments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. However, as tasks and methods become
more advanced, the action decision systems tend to become more complex and
operate as black-boxes. For a reliable system, the ability to explain or
describe its decisions is crucial; however, there tends to be a trade-off in
that explainable systems can not outperform non-explainable systems in terms of
performance. In this paper, we propose incorporating the task of describing
actions in language into the reinforcement learning of navigation as an
auxiliary task. Existing studies have found it difficult to incorporate
describing actions into reinforcement learning due to the absence of
ground-truth data. We address this issue by leveraging knowledge distillation
from pre-trained description generation models, such as vision-language models.
We comprehensively evaluate our approach across various navigation tasks,
demonstrating that it can describe actions while attaining high navigation
performance. Furthermore, it achieves state-of-the-art performance in the
particularly challenging multimodal navigation task of semantic audio-visual
navigation.

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR), a vision-threatening complication of Dia-betes
Mellitus (DM), is a major global concern, particularly in India, which has one
of the highest diabetic populations. Prolonged hyperglycemia damages reti-nal
microvasculature, leading to DR symptoms like microaneurysms, hemor-rhages, and
fluid leakage, which, if undetected, cause irreversible vision loss. Therefore,
early screening is crucial as DR is asymptomatic in its initial stages. Fundus
imaging aids precise diagnosis by detecting subtle retinal lesions. This paper
introduces a hybrid diagnostic framework combining traditional feature
extraction and deep learning (DL) to enhance DR detection. While handcrafted
features capture key clinical markers, DL automates hierarchical pattern
recog-nition, improving early diagnosis. The model synergizes interpretable
clinical data with learned features, surpassing standalone DL approaches that
demon-strate superior classification and reduce false negatives. This
multimodal AI-driven approach enables scalable, accurate DR screening, crucial
for diabetes-burdened regions.

Abstract: This article compares the performance of six prominent object detection
algorithms, YOLOv11, RetinaNet, Fast R-CNN, YOLOv8, RT-DETR, and DETR, on the
NEU-DET surface defect detection dataset, comprising images representing
various metal surface defects, a crucial application in industrial quality
control. Each model's performance was assessed regarding detection accuracy,
speed, and robustness across different defect types such as scratches,
inclusions, and rolled-in scales. YOLOv11, a state-of-the-art real-time object
detection algorithm, demonstrated superior performance compared to the other
methods, achieving a remarkable 70% higher accuracy on average. This
improvement can be attributed to YOLOv11s enhanced feature extraction
capabilities and ability to process the entire image in a single forward pass,
making it faster and more efficient in detecting minor surface defects.
Additionally, YOLOv11's architecture optimizations, such as improved anchor box
generation and deeper convolutional layers, contributed to more precise
localization of defects. In conclusion, YOLOv11's outstanding performance in
accuracy and speed solidifies its position as the most effective model for
surface defect detection on the NEU dataset, surpassing competing algorithms by
a substantial margin.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有EO模型需要额外适配且结构僵化的问题，借鉴大语言模型的统一序列处理方法。

Method: 采用GPT风格的单解码器架构，通过符号提示实现多样化任务的统一处理。

Result: 在作物类型分类任务上表现优于更大的EO模型，证明了密集时间序列建模的重要性。

Conclusion: SITS-DECO展示了数据驱动的建模范式，为未来生成式EO模型提供了轻量化路径。

Abstract: Earth Observation (EO) Foundation Modelling (FM) holds great promise for
simplifying and improving the use of EO data for diverse real-world tasks.
However, most existing models require additional adaptation before they can be
used and are structured rigidly around particular data sources or training
approaches. To address this, we take inspiration from large language models,
where diverse tasks, both pre-training and downstream, are implicitly captured
through next-token prediction over unified token sequences, leveraging the
structure and diversity of the training data.
  We introduce SITS-DECO (Satellite Image Time Series-DECoder Only), a
proof-of-concept generative model that applies this unified-sequence framing to
EO data. Using a simple GPT-style decoder-only architecture, and demonstrate
its ability to perform useful EO tasks (pixel-wise, multi-temporal, multi-modal
crop-type classification) in a purely generative framework. Through symbolic
prompting, we show that the model can perform multiple supervised and
self-supervised tasks within a single unified architecture, without task- or
modality-specific adaptation. Despite its simplicity and lack of spatial
context, SITS-DECO outperforms much larger EO foundation models on crop-type
classification (PASTIS-R) demonstrating that dense temporal sequence modelling
is a critical missing ingredient in the current paradigm.
  This work exemplifies a data-centric modelling paradigm in which capability
arises from the diversity and structure of the training data rather than from
architectural complexity. SITS-DECO provides a lightweight, practical route to
multi-modal, multi-task EO modelling, and a conceptual bridge toward future
generative EO foundation models.

Result: Gestura实现了鲁棒且适应性强的自由手势理解，并发布了首个开源数据集，包含超过30万标注的QA对。

Conclusion: Gestura通过多模块协作显著改进了自由手势理解的性能，为人机交互提供了更高效的工具。

Abstract: Free-form gesture understanding is highly appealing for human-computer
interaction, as it liberates users from the constraints of predefined gesture
categories. However, the sole existing solution GestureGPT suffers from limited
recognition accuracy and slow response times. In this paper, we propose
Gestura, an end-to-end system for free-form gesture understanding. Gestura
harnesses a pre-trained Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to align the highly
dynamic and diverse patterns of free-form gestures with high-level semantic
concepts. To better capture subtle hand movements across different styles, we
introduce a Landmark Processing Module that compensate for LVLMs' lack of
fine-grained domain knowledge by embedding anatomical hand priors. Further, a
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning strategy enables step-by-step semantic
inference, transforming shallow knowledge into deep semantic understanding and
significantly enhancing the model's ability to interpret ambiguous or
unconventional gestures. Together, these components allow Gestura to achieve
robust and adaptable free-form gesture comprehension. Additionally, we have
developed the first open-source dataset for free-form gesture intention
reasoning and understanding with over 300,000 annotated QA pairs.

Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) holds enormous potential for improving medical imaging
diagnostics, yet the lack of interpretability in most models hampers clinical
trust and adoption. This paper presents an explainable deep learning framework
for detecting brain tumors in MRI scans and pneumonia in chest X-ray images
using two leading Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50 and DenseNet121.
These models were trained on publicly available Kaggle datasets comprising
7,023 brain MRI images and 5,863 chest X-ray images, achieving high
classification performance. DenseNet121 consistently outperformed ResNet50 with
94.3 percent vs. 92.5 percent accuracy for brain tumors and 89.1 percent vs.
84.4 percent accuracy for pneumonia. For better explainability,
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was integrated to create
heatmap visualizations superimposed on the test images, indicating the most
influential image regions in the decision-making process. Interestingly, while
both models produced accurate results, Grad-CAM showed that DenseNet121
consistently focused on core pathological regions, whereas ResNet50 sometimes
scattered attention to peripheral or non-pathological areas. Combining deep
learning and explainable AI offers a promising path toward reliable,
interpretable, and clinically useful diagnostic tools.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在处理视觉模态中的抽象关系信息（如MMRK）时存在不足，尤其是在结构化抽象推理（STAR）任务上。缺乏高质量数据和方法论是主要挑战。

Method: 论文提出了一个自动STAR数据引擎用于生成多模态指令数据，并结合两阶段的训练框架来提升模型能力。此外，还设计了针对STAR任务的评测协议。

Conclusion: 通过STAR-64K数据集和两阶段训练框架，论文成功提升了MLLMs在STAR任务上的表现，展示了其方法的实用性和潜力。

Abstract: Understanding and reasoning with abstractive information from the visual
modality presents significant challenges for current multi-modal large language
models (MLLMs). Among the various forms of abstractive information, Multi-Modal
Relational Knowledge (MMRK), which represents abstract relational structures
between multi-modal entities using node-edge formats, remains largely
under-explored. In particular, STructured and Abstractive Reasoning (STAR) on
such data has received little attention from the research community. To bridge
the dual gaps in large-scale high-quality data and capability enhancement
methodologies, this paper makes the following key contributions: (i). An
automatic STAR data engine capable of synthesizing images with MMRK to build
multi-modal instruction data with reliable chain-of-thought thinking for
various STAR tasks and (ii). A comprehsive two-stage capability enhancement
training framework, accompanied by a suite of evaluation protocols tailored to
different STAR tasks. Based upon these contributions, we introduce STAR-64K, a
dataset comprising 64K high-quality multi-modal instruction samples, and
conduct experiments across 5 open-source MLLMs. Experimental results show that
our two-stage enhancement framework enables smaller 3B/7B models to
significantly outperform GPT-4o in STAR. Additionally, we provide in-depth
analysis regarding the effectiveness of various designs, data transferability,
and scalability.

Abstract: In recent years, multimodal medical data-based survival analysis has
attracted much attention. However, real-world datasets often suffer from the
problem of incomplete modality, where some patient modality information is
missing due to acquisition limitations or system failures. Existing methods
typically infer missing modalities directly from observed ones using deep
neural networks, but they often ignore the distributional discrepancy across
modalities, resulting in inconsistent and unreliable modality reconstruction.
To address these challenges, we propose a novel framework that combines a
low-rank Transformer with a flow-based generative model for robust and flexible
multimodal survival prediction. Specifically, we first formulate the concerned
problem as incomplete multimodal survival analysis using the multi-instance
representation of whole slide images (WSIs) and genomic profiles. To realize
incomplete multimodal survival analysis, we propose a class-specific flow for
cross-modal distribution alignment. Under the condition of class labels, we
model and transform the cross-modal distribution. By virtue of the reversible
structure and accurate density modeling capabilities of the normalizing flow
model, the model can effectively construct a distribution-consistent latent
space of the missing modality, thereby improving the consistency between the
reconstructed data and the true distribution. Finally, we design a lightweight
Transformer architecture to model intra-modal dependencies while alleviating
the overfitting problem in high-dimensional modality fusion by virtue of the
low-rank Transformer. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that our method
not only achieves state-of-the-art performance under complete modality
settings, but also maintains robust and superior accuracy under the incomplete
modalities scenario.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种方法（基于手工特征的机器学习、深度学习架构和混合方法）在垃圾图像分类中的表现，发现混合方法在准确性和效率上均优于其他方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球废物管理中基于图像的自动化垃圾分类是关键，但缺乏系统性的基准方法。

Method: 比较了三种方法：(1)手工特征的机器学习算法，(2)深度学习架构（如ResNet和EfficientNetV2S），(3)结合深度模型特征提取和传统分类器的混合方法。

Result: 混合方法在三个公开数据集上表现最佳，准确率高达100%，并通过特征选择减少95%的特征维度而不降低准确性。

Conclusion: 研究确立了更可靠的垃圾分类基准，并提出了一种高效混合框架，适用于资源受限环境的大规模部署。

Abstract: Automated image-based garbage classification is a critical component of
global waste management; however, systematic benchmarks that integrate Machine
Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and efficient hybrid solutions remain
underdeveloped. This study provides a comprehensive comparison of three
paradigms: (1) machine learning algorithms using handcrafted features, (2) deep
learning architectures, including ResNet variants and EfficientNetV2S, and (3)
a hybrid approach that utilizes deep models for feature extraction combined
with classical classifiers such as Support Vector Machine and Logistic
Regression to identify the most effective strategy. Experiments on three public
datasets - TrashNet, Garbage Classification, and a refined Household Garbage
Dataset (with 43 corrected mislabels)- demonstrate that the hybrid method
consistently outperforms the others, achieving up to 100% accuracy on TrashNet
and the refined Household set, and 99.87% on Garbage Classification, thereby
surpassing state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, feature selection reduces
feature dimensionality by over 95% without compromising accuracy, resulting in
faster training and inference. This work establishes more reliable benchmarks
for waste classification and introduces an efficient hybrid framework that
achieves high accuracy while reducing inference cost, making it suitable for
scalable deployment in resource-constrained environments.

Motivation: 研究旨在探索ChatGPT在医学图像解释中的潜力，特别是在未经微调的情况下是否能可靠地分类胸部X光片。

Method: 使用平衡的测试集（400张图像，两类各200张），通过四种不同的提示设计（从简洁到详细推理）评估模型。

Result: 简洁、特征导向的提示取得了74%的最高分类准确率，而推理导向的提示表现较差。

Conclusion: ChatGPT在医学图像解释方面显示出潜力，但诊断可靠性有限，需进一步改进视觉推理和领域适应性才能应用于临床。

Abstract: In this study, we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's gpt-4o model to classify
chest X-ray images as either NORMAL or PNEUMONIA in a zero-shot setting,
without any prior fine-tuning. A balanced test set of 400 images (200 from each
class) was used to assess performance across four distinct prompt designs,
ranging from minimal instructions to detailed, reasoning-based prompts. The
results indicate that concise, feature-focused prompts achieved the highest
classification accuracy of 74\%, whereas reasoning-oriented prompts resulted in
lower performance. These findings highlight that while ChatGPT exhibits
emerging potential for medical image interpretation, its diagnostic reliability
remains limited. Continued advances in visual reasoning and domain-specific
adaptation are required before such models can be safely applied in clinical
practice.

Abstract: This is a short technical report describing the winning entry of the
PhysicsIQ Challenge, presented at the Perception Test Workshop at ICCV 2025.
State-of-the-art video generative models exhibit severely limited physical
understanding, and often produce implausible videos. The Physics IQ benchmark
has shown that visual realism does not imply physics understanding. Yet,
intuitive physics understanding has shown to emerge from SSL pretraining on
natural videos. In this report, we investigate whether we can leverage
SSL-based video world models to improve the physics plausibility of video
generative models. In particular, we build ontop of the state-of-the-art video
generative model MAGI-1 and couple it with the recently introduced Video Joint
Embedding Predictive Architecture 2 (VJEPA-2) to guide the generation process.
We show that by leveraging VJEPA-2 as reward signal, we can improve the physics
plausibility of state-of-the-art video generative models by ~6%.

Conclusion: 模态失语症揭示了多模态模型的局限性，并强调了跨模态对齐在AI安全中的重要性。

Abstract: We present modal aphasia, a systematic dissociation in which current unified
multimodal models accurately memorize concepts visually but fail to articulate
them in writing, despite being trained on images and text simultaneously. For
one, we show that leading frontier models can generate near-perfect
reproductions of iconic movie artwork, but confuse crucial details when asked
for textual descriptions. We corroborate those findings through controlled
experiments on synthetic datasets in multiple architectures. Our experiments
confirm that modal aphasia reliably emerges as a fundamental property of
current unified multimodal models, not just as a training artifact. In
practice, modal aphasia can introduce vulnerabilities in AI safety frameworks,
as safeguards applied to one modality may leave harmful concepts accessible in
other modalities. We demonstrate this risk by showing how a model aligned
solely on text remains capable of generating unsafe images.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The Poisson Flow Consistency Model (PFCM) is a consistency-style model based
on the robust Poisson Flow Generative Model++ (PFGM++) which has achieved
success in unconditional image generation and CT image denoising. Yet the PFCM
can only be trained in distillation which limits the potential of the PFCM in
many data modalities. The objective of this research was to create a method to
train the PFCM in isolation called Poisson Flow Consistency Training (PFCT).
The perturbation kernel was leveraged to remove the pretrained PFGM++, and the
sinusoidal discretization schedule and Beta noise distribution were introduced
in order to facilitate adaptability and improve sample quality. The model was
applied to the task of low dose computed tomography image denoising and
improved the low dose image in terms of LPIPS and SSIM. It also displayed
similar denoising effectiveness as models like the Consistency Model. PFCT is
established as a valid method of training the PFCM from its effectiveness in
denoising CT images, showing potential with competitive results to other
generative models. Further study is needed in the precise optimization of PFCT
and in its applicability to other generative modeling tasks. The framework of
PFCT creates more flexibility for the ways in which a PFCM can be created and
can be applied to the field of generative modeling.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式标签表示情感和身份，限制了泛化能力和自然性，LSF-Animation旨在解决这一问题，充分利用语音中的情感线索。

Method: LSF-Animation通过中性面部网格捕捉身份特征，从语音中隐含提取情感信息，并引入分层交互融合块（HIFB）整合多模态特征。

Result: 在3DMEAD数据集上的实验表明，该方法在情感表达、身份泛化和动画真实性方面优于当前最优方法。

Conclusion: LSF-Animation通过无标签特征提取和分层融合，显著提升了语音驱动3D人脸动画的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Speech-driven 3D facial animation has attracted increasing interest since its
potential to generate expressive and temporally synchronized digital humans.
While recent works have begun to explore emotion-aware animation, they still
depend on explicit one-hot encodings to represent identity and emotion with
given emotion and identity labels, which limits their ability to generalize to
unseen speakers. Moreover, the emotional cues inherently present in speech are
often neglected, limiting the naturalness and adaptability of generated
animations. In this work, we propose LSF-Animation, a novel framework that
eliminates the reliance on explicit emotion and identity feature
representations. Specifically, LSF-Animation implicitly extracts emotion
information from speech and captures the identity features from a neutral
facial mesh, enabling improved generalization to unseen speakers and emotional
states without requiring manual labels. Furthermore, we introduce a
Hierarchical Interaction Fusion Block (HIFB), which employs a fusion token to
integrate dual transformer features and more effectively integrate emotional,
motion-related and identity-related cues. Extensive experiments conducted on
the 3DMEAD dataset demonstrate that our method surpasses recent
state-of-the-art approaches in terms of emotional expressiveness, identity
generalization, and animation realism. The source code will be released at:

Abstract: Accurate and reliable motion forecasting is essential for the safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in rare but safety-critical
scenarios known as corner cases. Existing models often underperform in these
situations due to an over-representation of common scenes in training data and
limited generalization capabilities. To address this limitation, we present
WM-MoE, the first world model-based motion forecasting framework that unifies
perception, temporal memory, and decision making to address the challenges of
high-risk corner-case scenarios. The model constructs a compact scene
representation that explains current observations, anticipates future dynamics,
and evaluates the outcomes of potential actions. To enhance long-horizon
reasoning, we leverage large language models (LLMs) and introduce a lightweight
temporal tokenizer that maps agent trajectories and contextual cues into the
LLM's feature space without additional training, enriching temporal context and
commonsense priors. Furthermore, a mixture-of-experts (MoE) is introduced to
decompose complex corner cases into subproblems and allocate capacity across
scenario types, and a router assigns scenes to specialized experts that infer
agent intent and perform counterfactual rollouts. In addition, we introduce
nuScenes-corner, a new benchmark that comprises four real-world corner-case
scenarios for rigorous evaluation. Extensive experiments on four benchmark
datasets (nuScenes, NGSIM, HighD, and MoCAD) showcase that WM-MoE consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines and remains robust under
corner-case and data-missing conditions, indicating the promise of world
model-based architectures for robust and generalizable motion forecasting in
fully AVs.

Abstract: Accurate assessment of urban canopy coverage is crucial for informed urban
planning, effective environmental monitoring, and mitigating the impacts of
climate change. Traditional practices often face limitations due to inadequate
technical requirements, difficulties in scaling and data processing, and the
lack of specialized expertise. This study presents an efficient approach for
estimating green canopy coverage using artificial intelligence, specifically
computer vision techniques, applied to aerial imageries. Our proposed
methodology utilizes object-based image analysis, based on deep learning
algorithms to accurately identify and segment green canopies from
high-resolution drone images. This approach allows the user for detailed
analysis of urban vegetation, capturing variations in canopy density and
understanding spatial distribution. To overcome the computational challenges
associated with processing large datasets, it was implemented over a cloud
platform utilizing high-performance processors. This infrastructure efficiently
manages space complexity and ensures affordable latency, enabling the rapid
analysis of vast amounts of drone imageries. Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of this approach in accurately estimating canopy coverage at the
city scale, providing valuable insights for urban forestry management of an
industrial township. The resultant data generated by this method can be used to
optimize tree plantation and assess the carbon sequestration potential of urban
forests. By integrating these insights into sustainable urban planning, we can
foster more resilient urban environments, contributing to a greener and

TernaryCLIP incorporates quantization-aware training and distillation modules,
preventing precision degradation and enabling low-cost and high-efficiency

achieve up to 99\% ternarized weights with 1.58-bit representation, 16.98

storage reduction, 10 $\times$ memory optimization, and 60\% sparsity while
maintaining promising performance on zero-shot image classification and

highlights the feasibility of extreme quantization for large multimodal models,
supporting effective and efficient deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Abstract: In recent years, diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in
high-fidelity image synthesis. However, fine-tuning these models for
specialized domains, such as medical imaging, remains challenging due to
limited domain-specific data and the high computational cost of full model
adaptation. In this paper, we introduce Lite-Diff (Lightweight Diffusion Model
Adaptation), a novel finetuning approach that integrates lightweight adaptation
layers into a frozen diffusion U-Net while enhancing training with a latent
morphological autoencoder (for domain-specific latent consistency) and a pixel
level discriminator(for adversarial alignment). By freezing weights of the base
model and optimizing only small residual adapter modules, LiteDiff
significantly reduces the computational overhead and mitigates overfitting,
even in minimal-data settings. Additionally, we conduct ablation studies to
analyze the effects of selectively integrating adaptation layers in different
U-Net blocks, revealing an optimal balance between efficiency and performance.
Experiments on three chest X-ray datasets - (1) Kaggle Chest X-Ray Pneumonia,
(2) NIH Chest X-ray14 and (3) VinBigData Chest X_ray demonstrate that LiteDiff
achieves superior adaptation efficiency compared to naive full fine-tuning. Our
framework provides a promising direction for transfer learning in diffusion
models, facilitating their deployment in diverse low data domains.

Motivation: 由于扩散和流匹配模型的迭代采样过程计算成本高，现有方法难以直接控制最终生成的图像。因此，需要一种高效的优化方法来解决这一问题。

Method: FlowOpt采用零阶优化策略，将整个采样路径作为黑箱进行处理，通过监控中间结果支持早期停止，并提出了步长的理论保证和实际估计方法。

Conclusion: FlowOpt为扩散和流匹配模型提供了一种高效的优化框架，适用于控制生成任务，且具有理论和实际的双重优势。

Abstract: The remarkable success of diffusion and flow-matching models has ignited a
surge of works on adapting them at test time for controlled generation tasks.
Examples range from image editing to restoration, compression and
personalization. However, due to the iterative nature of the sampling process
in those models, it is computationally impractical to use gradient-based
optimization to directly control the image generated at the end of the process.
As a result, existing methods typically resort to manipulating each timestep
separately. Here we introduce FlowOpt - a zero-order (gradient-free)
optimization framework that treats the entire flow process as a black box,
enabling optimization through the whole sampling path without backpropagation
through the model. Our method is both highly efficient and allows users to
monitor the intermediate optimization results and perform early stopping if
desired. We prove a sufficient condition on FlowOpt's step-size, under which
convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed. We further show how to
empirically estimate this upper bound so as to choose an appropriate step-size.
We demonstrate how FlowOpt can be used for image editing, showcasing two
options: (i) inversion (determining the initial noise that generates a given
image), and (ii) directly steering the edited image to be similar to the source
image while conforming to a target text prompt. In both cases, FlowOpt achieves
state-of-the-art results while using roughly the same number of neural function
evaluations (NFEs) as existing methods. Code and examples are available on the
project's webpage.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Anomaly detection in surveillance videos remains a challenging task due to
the diversity of abnormal events, class imbalance, and scene-dependent visual
clutter. To address these issues, we propose a robust deep learning framework
that integrates human-centric preprocessing with spatio-temporal modeling for
multi-class anomaly classification. Our pipeline begins by applying YOLO-World
- an open-vocabulary vision-language detector - to identify human instances in
raw video clips, followed by ByteTrack for consistent identity-aware tracking.
Background regions outside detected bounding boxes are suppressed via Gaussian
blurring, effectively reducing scene-specific distractions and focusing the
model on behaviorally relevant foreground content. The refined frames are then
processed by an ImageNet-pretrained InceptionV3 network for spatial feature
extraction, and temporal dynamics are captured using a bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) for sequence-level classification. Evaluated on a five-class subset of
the UCF-Crime dataset (Normal, Burglary, Fighting, Arson, Explosion), our
method achieves a mean test accuracy of 92.41% across three independent trials,
with per-class F1-scores consistently exceeding 0.85. Comprehensive evaluation
metrics - including confusion matrices, ROC curves, and macro/weighted averages
- demonstrate strong generalization and resilience to class imbalance. The
results confirm that foreground-focused preprocessing significantly enhances
anomaly discrimination in real-world surveillance scenarios.

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) often generate hallucination, i.e., content
that cannot be substantiated by either textual or visual inputs. Prior work
primarily attributes this to over-reliance on linguistic prior knowledge rather
than visual inputs. Some methods attempt to mitigate hallucination by
amplifying visual token attention proportionally to their attention scores.
However, these methods overlook the visual attention sink problem, where
attention is frequently misallocated to task-irrelevant visual regions, and
neglect cross-modal fusion balance by enhancing only visual attention without
adjusting attention to the user query. This can result in amplifying incorrect
areas while failing to properly interpret the user query. To address these
challenges, we propose a simple yet effective method called Gaze Shift-Guided
Cross-modal Fusion Enhancement (GIFT). GIFT pre-computes a holistic visual
saliency map by tracking positive changes in visual attention, or "gaze
shifts", during user query comprehension, and leverages this map to amplify
attention to both salient visual information and the user query at each
decoding step. This reduces the impact of visual attention sink, as irrelevant
tokens exhibit minimal shifts, while ensuring balanced cross-modal fusion for
well-integrated representation. Extensive experiments show that GIFT
effectively mitigates hallucination in VLMs across both generative and
classification tasks, achieving up to 20.7% improvement over greedy decoding,
while maintaining general vision-language performance with low computational
overhead.

Abstract: The variability introduced by differences in MRI scanner models, acquisition
protocols, and imaging sites hinders consistent analysis and generalizability
across multicenter studies. We present a novel image-based harmonization
framework for 3D T1-weighted brain MRI, which disentangles anatomical content
from scanner- and site-specific variations. The model incorporates a
differentiable loss based on the Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) to preserve
biologically meaningful features while reducing inter-site variability. This
loss enables separate evaluation of image luminance, contrast, and structural
components. Training and validation were performed on multiple publicly
available datasets spanning diverse scanners and sites, with testing on both
healthy and clinical populations. Harmonization using multiple style targets,
including style-agnostic references, produced consistent and high-quality
outputs. Visual comparisons, voxel intensity distributions, and SSIM-based
metrics demonstrated that harmonized images achieved strong alignment across
acquisition settings while maintaining anatomical fidelity. Following
harmonization, structural SSIM reached 0.97, luminance SSIM ranged from 0.98 to
0.99, and Wasserstein distances between mean voxel intensity distributions
decreased substantially. Downstream tasks showed substantial improvements: mean
absolute error for brain age prediction decreased from 5.36 to 3.30 years, and
Alzheimer's disease classification AUC increased from 0.78 to 0.85. Overall,
our framework enhances cross-site image consistency, preserves anatomical
fidelity, and improves downstream model performance, providing a robust and
generalizable solution for large-scale multicenter neuroimaging studies.

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at vision-language tasks such
as VQA and document understanding, yet precise coordinate prediction remains
challenging. High-resolution inputs exacerbate this difficulty by producing
long token sequences that weaken positional encodings and introduce directional
biases in coordinate outputs. We investigate this phenomenon by analyzing how
MLLMs behave when visual positional encodings (VPEs) are deliberately perturbed
through shuffling. Our analysis reveals that such perturbations induce
predictable, non-random coordinate biases rather than random errors, suggesting
that models rely on internal positional priors when spatial grounding signals
are degraded. Crucially, we observe similar directional error patterns in
natural high-resolution datasets, indicating that positional encoding failures
are a key bottleneck for accurate coordinate prediction at scale. To address
this issue, we propose Vision-PE Shuffle Guidance (VPSG), a training-free
test-time method that leverages the directional nature of these biases for
correction. VPSG runs auxiliary decoding with shuffled VPEs to isolate
position-unconditioned tendencies, then uses this as negative evidence to guide
digit prediction while preserving coordinate format through a lightweight
finite-state machine. Experiments on ScreenSpot-Pro demonstrate reliable
improvements, highlighting positional encoding robustness as a critical factor
for spatial reasoning in MLLMs.

Abstract: Capturing diversity is crucial in conditional and prompt-based image
generation, particularly when conditions contain uncertainty that can lead to
multiple plausible outputs. To generate diverse images reflecting this
diversity, traditional methods often modify random seeds, making it difficult
to discern meaningful differences between samples, or diversify the input
prompt, which is limited in verbally interpretable diversity. We propose
Rainbow, a novel conditional image generation framework, applicable to any
pretrained conditional generative model, that addresses inherent
condition/prompt uncertainty and generates diverse plausible images. Rainbow is
based on a simple yet effective idea: decomposing the input condition into
diverse latent representations, each capturing an aspect of the uncertainty and
generating a distinct image. First, we integrate a latent graph, parameterized
by Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets), into the prompt representation
computation. Second, leveraging GFlowNets' advanced graph sampling capabilities
to capture uncertainty and output diverse trajectories over the graph, we
produce multiple trajectories that collectively represent the input condition,
leading to diverse condition representations and corresponding output images.
Evaluations on natural image and medical image datasets demonstrate Rainbow's
improvement in both diversity and fidelity across image synthesis, image
generation, and counterfactual generation tasks.

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on many
vision-language tasks but often struggle with spatial reasoning\textemdash{}a
prerequisite for many applications. Empirically, we find that a dataset
produced by a current training data generation pipeline has a 57.6\% human
validation rate. These rates stem from current limitations: single-image 3D
reconstruction introduces cascading modeling errors and requires wide answer
tolerances, while caption-based methods require hyper-detailed annotations and
suffer from generative hallucinations. We present GRAID, built on the key
insight that qualitative spatial relationships can be reliably determined from
2D geometric primitives alone. By operating exclusively on 2D bounding boxes
from standard object detectors, GRAID avoids both 3D reconstruction errors and
generative hallucinations, resulting in datasets that are of higher quality
than existing tools that produce similar datasets as validated by human
evaluations. We apply our framework to the BDD100k, NuImages, and Waymo
datasets, generating over 8.5 million high-quality VQA pairs creating questions
spanning spatial relations, counting, ranking, and size comparisons. We
evaluate one of the datasets and find it achieves 91.16\% human-validated
accuracy\textemdash{}compared to 57.6\% on a dataset generated by recent work.
% or recent work Critically, we demonstrate that when trained on GRAID data,
models learn spatial reasoning concepts that generalize: models fine-tuned on 6
question types improve on over 10 held-out types, with accuracy gains of 47.5\%
on BDD and 37.9\% on NuImages for Llama 3.2B 11B, and when trained on all

Motivation: 当前深度立体匹配虽然通过微调在基准数据集上取得了进展，但在零样本泛化方面表现不足，类似其他视觉任务中的基础模型。为了解决这一问题，论文提出了CogStereo框架，专注于在遮挡和弱纹理区域实现更好的性能。

Method: CogStereo框架将隐式空间认知嵌入细化过程，使用单目深度特征作为先验，捕捉超越局部对应的整体场景理解。它采用双重条件细化机制，结合像素级不确定性和认知引导特征，进行全局一致的误匹配校正。

Result: 实验在Scene Flow、KITTI、Middlebury、ETH3D、EuRoc等多个数据集上验证了CogStereo的先进性，不仅达到了最先进的结果，还在跨域泛化中表现出色。

Conclusion: CogStereo的成功标志着立体视觉向认知驱动方法的转变，为解决复杂区域的深度估计问题提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Deep stereo matching has advanced significantly on benchmark datasets through
fine-tuning but falls short of the zero-shot generalization seen in foundation
models in other vision tasks. We introduce CogStereo, a novel framework that
addresses challenging regions, such as occlusions or weak textures, without
relying on dataset-specific priors. CogStereo embeds implicit spatial cognition
into the refinement process by using monocular depth features as priors,
capturing holistic scene understanding beyond local correspondences. This
approach ensures structurally coherent disparity estimation, even in areas
where geometry alone is inadequate. CogStereo employs a dual-conditional
refinement mechanism that combines pixel-wise uncertainty with cognition-guided
features for consistent global correction of mismatches. Extensive experiments
on Scene Flow, KITTI, Middlebury, ETH3D, EuRoc, and real-world demonstrate that
CogStereo not only achieves state-of-the-art results but also excels in
cross-domain generalization, shifting stereo vision towards a cognition-driven
approach.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP achieve strong zero-shot
generalization but remain vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by input
corruptions. In this work, we investigate how corruptions affect CLIP's image
embeddings and uncover a consistent phenomenon we term as embedding variance
collapse, where both intra-class and inter-class variances shrink as corruption
severity increases. We find that this collapse is closely tied to performance
degradation, with inter-class variance strongly correlated with classification
accuracy. To explain this phenomenon, we analyze how corruptions alter the
structure of the embedding space. Our theoretical results suggest that the
visual encoder tends to encode corruption-related signals, which dilute
class-discriminative features and compress the representation geometry. We
further show that maximizing inter-class variance, even when estimated from
pseudo-labels, can provably enhance embedding quality. Based on this insight,
we propose Mint, a simple test-time adaptation method that maximizes
pseudo-label-based inter-class variance on the fly using a mean accumulator and
a gradient accumulator. Mint operates effectively with small batch sizes and
consistently improves performance across multiple corruption benchmarks and
CLIP architectures. Our code is available at https://github.com/baowenxuan/Mint .

<details>

Motivation: 现有自我中心视觉基准忽略了情感状态对人类行为的驱动作用，限制了视觉系统捕捉行为内在驱动力的能力。

Method: 论文收集了43名参与者的超过50小时的同步数据（视觉、生理信号等），并使用多种模型（Circumplex Model、Mikels' Wheel、Big Five）进行情感和人格自我报告。

Result: 实验表明，基于自我中心视觉系统的学习方法在情感预测上优于生理信号处理方法。

Conclusion: egoEMOTION数据集确立了情感和人格在自我中心感知中的核心地位，为行为、意图和交互建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Understanding affect is central to anticipating human behavior, yet current
egocentric vision benchmarks largely ignore the person's emotional states that
shape their decisions and actions. Existing tasks in egocentric perception
focus on physical activities, hand-object interactions, and attention modeling
- assuming neutral affect and uniform personality. This limits the ability of
vision systems to capture key internal drivers of behavior. In this paper, we
present egoEMOTION, the first dataset that couples egocentric visual and
physiological signals with dense self-reports of emotion and personality across
controlled and real-world scenarios. Our dataset includes over 50 hours of
recordings from 43 participants, captured using Meta's Project Aria glasses.
Each session provides synchronized eye-tracking video, headmounted
photoplethysmography, inertial motion data, and physiological baselines for
reference. Participants completed emotion-elicitation tasks and naturalistic
activities while self-reporting their affective state using the Circumplex
Model and Mikels' Wheel as well as their personality via the Big Five model. We
define three benchmark tasks: (1) continuous affect classification (valence,
arousal, dominance); (2) discrete emotion classification; and (3) trait-level
personality inference. We show that a classical learning-based method, as a
simple baseline in real-world affect prediction, produces better estimates from
signals captured on egocentric vision systems than processing physiological
signals. Our dataset establishes emotion and personality as core dimensions in
egocentric perception and opens new directions in affect-driven modeling of
behavior, intent, and interaction.

Conclusion: STG-Avatar为解决非刚性对象和动态区域的细节重建提供了有效方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Realistic animatable human avatars from monocular videos are crucial for
advancing human-robot interaction and enhancing immersive virtual experiences.
While recent research on 3DGS-based human avatars has made progress, it still
struggles with accurately representing detailed features of non-rigid objects
(e.g., clothing deformations) and dynamic regions (e.g., rapidly moving limbs).
To address these challenges, we present STG-Avatar, a 3DGS-based framework for
high-fidelity animatable human avatar reconstruction. Specifically, our
framework introduces a rigid-nonrigid coupled deformation framework that
synergistically integrates Spacetime Gaussians (STG) with linear blend skinning
(LBS). In this hybrid design, LBS enables real-time skeletal control by driving
global pose transformations, while STG complements it through spacetime
adaptive optimization of 3D Gaussians. Furthermore, we employ optical flow to
identify high-dynamic regions and guide the adaptive densification of 3D
Gaussians in these regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both reconstruction
quality and operational efficiency, achieving superior quantitative metrics
while retaining real-time rendering capabilities. Our code is available at

Conclusion: LOC框架有效提升了3D场景理解的性能，无需额外训练数据即可识别未知类别。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in open-set
challenges. However, the limited availability of 3D datasets hinders their
effective application in 3D scene understanding. We propose LOC, a general
language-guided framework adaptable to various occupancy networks, supporting
both supervised and self-supervised learning paradigms. For self-supervised
tasks, we employ a strategy that fuses multi-frame LiDAR points for
dynamic/static scenes, using Poisson reconstruction to fill voids, and
assigning semantics to voxels via K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) to obtain
comprehensive voxel representations. To mitigate feature over-homogenization
caused by direct high-dimensional feature distillation, we introduce Densely
Contrastive Learning (DCL). DCL leverages dense voxel semantic information and
predefined textual prompts. This efficiently enhances open-set recognition
without dense pixel-level supervision, and our framework can also leverage
existing ground truth to further improve performance. Our model predicts dense
voxel features embedded in the CLIP feature space, integrating textual and
image pixel information, and classifies based on text and semantic similarity.
Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the method's superior
performance, achieving high-precision predictions for known classes and
distinguishing unknown classes without additional training data.

Abstract: Participating in efforts to endow generative AI with the 3D physical world
perception, we propose I2-NeRF, a novel neural radiance field framework that
enhances isometric and isotropic metric perception under media degradation.
While existing NeRF models predominantly rely on object-centric sampling,
I2-NeRF introduces a reverse-stratified upsampling strategy to achieve
near-uniform sampling across 3D space, thereby preserving isometry. We further
present a general radiative formulation for media degradation that unifies
emission, absorption, and scattering into a particle model governed by the
Beer-Lambert attenuation law. By composing the direct and media-induced
in-scatter radiance, this formulation extends naturally to complex media
environments such as underwater, haze, and even low-light scenes. By treating
light propagation uniformly in both vertical and horizontal directions, I2-NeRF
enables isotropic metric perception and can even estimate medium properties
such as water depth. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly improves both reconstruction fidelity and physical
plausibility compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: The growing deployment of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in high-stakes
applications such as autonomous driving and assistive technologies for visually
impaired individuals necessitates reliable mechanisms to assess the
trustworthiness of their generation. Uncertainty Estimation (UE) plays a
central role in quantifying the reliability of model outputs and reducing
unsafe generations via selective prediction. In this regard, most existing
probability-based UE approaches rely on output probability distributions,
aggregating token probabilities into a single uncertainty score using
predefined functions such as length-normalization. Another line of research
leverages model hidden representations and trains MLP-based models to predict
uncertainty. However, these methods often fail to capture the complex
multimodal relationships between semantic and textual tokens and struggle to
identify biased probabilities often influenced by language priors. Motivated by
these observations, we propose a novel UE framework, HARMONY, that jointly
leverages fused multimodal information in model activations and the output
distribution of the VLM to determine the reliability of responses. The key
hypothesis of our work is that both the model's internal belief in its visual
understanding, captured by its hidden representations, and the produced token
probabilities carry valuable reliability signals that can be jointly leveraged
to improve UE performance, surpassing approaches that rely on only one of these
components. Experimental results on three open-ended VQA benchmarks, A-OKVQA,
VizWiz, and PathVQA, and three state-of-the-art VLMs, LLaVa-7b, LLaVA-13b and
InstructBLIP demonstrate that our method consistently performs on par with or
better than existing approaches, achieving up to 4\% improvement in AUROC, and
6\% in PRR, establishing new state of the art in uncertainty estimation for
VLMs.

Abstract: Scaling and architectural advances have produced strikingly photorealistic
image generative models, yet their mechanisms still remain opaque. Rather than
advancing scaling, our goal is to strip away complicated engineering tricks and
propose a simple, non-parametric generative model. Our design is grounded in
three principles of natural images-(i) spatial non-stationarity, (ii) low-level
regularities, and (iii) high-level semantics-and defines each pixel's
distribution from its local context window. Despite its minimal architecture
and no training, the model produces high-fidelity samples on MNIST and visually
compelling CIFAR-10 images. This combination of simplicity and strong empirical
performance points toward a minimal theory of natural-image structure. The
model's white-box nature also allows us to have a mechanistic understanding of
how the model generalizes and generates diverse images. We study it by tracing
each generated pixel back to its source images. These analyses reveal a simple,
compositional procedure for "part-whole generalization", suggesting a
hypothesis for how large neural network generative models learn to generalize.

Abstract: Generating realistic full-body motion interacting with objects is critical
for applications in robotics, virtual reality, and human-computer interaction.
While existing methods can generate full-body motion within 3D scenes, they
often lack the fidelity for fine-grained tasks like object grasping.
Conversely, methods that generate precise grasping motions typically ignore the
surrounding 3D scene. This gap, generating full-body grasping motions that are
physically plausible within a 3D scene, remains a significant challenge. To
address this, we introduce MOGRAS (Human MOtion with GRAsping in 3D Scenes), a
large-scale dataset that bridges this gap. MOGRAS provides pre-grasping
full-body walking motions and final grasping poses within richly annotated 3D
indoor scenes. We leverage MOGRAS to benchmark existing full-body grasping
methods and demonstrate their limitations in scene-aware generation.
Furthermore, we propose a simple yet effective method to adapt existing
approaches to work seamlessly within 3D scenes. Through extensive quantitative
and qualitative experiments, we validate the effectiveness of our dataset and
highlight the significant improvements our proposed method achieves, paving the
way for more realistic human-scene interactions.

generates dynamics in a fast feed-forward manner. The key success of our
approach is the use of a compact sparse voxel spectrum to represent the tree
movement. Given a 3D tree from Gaussian Splatting reconstruction, our pipeline
first generates mesh motion using the sparse voxel spectrum and then binds
Gaussians to deform the mesh. Additionally, the proposed sparse voxel spectrum
can also serve as a basis for fast modal analysis under external forces,
allowing real-time interactive responses. To train our model, we also introduce
4DTree, the first large-scale synthetic 4D tree dataset containing 8,786
animated tree meshes with semantic labels and 100-frame motion sequences.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves realistic and
responsive tree animations, significantly outperforming existing approaches in
both visual quality and computational efficiency.

Abstract: Domain Adaptation (DA) provides an effective way to tackle target-domain
tasks by leveraging knowledge learned from source domains. Recent studies have
extended this paradigm to Multi-Source Domain Adaptation (MSDA), which exploits
multiple source domains carrying richer and more diverse transferable
information. However, a substantial performance gap still remains between
adaptation-based methods and fully supervised learning. In this paper, we
explore a more practical and challenging setting, named Multi-Source Active
Domain Adaptation (MS-ADA), to further enhance target-domain performance by
selectively acquiring annotations from the target domain. The key difficulty of
MS-ADA lies in designing selection criteria that can jointly handle inter-class
diversity and multi-source domain variation. To address these challenges, we
propose a simple yet effective GALA strategy (GALA), which combines a global
k-means clustering step for target-domain samples with a cluster-wise local
selection criterion, effectively tackling the above two issues in a
complementary manner. Our proposed GALA is plug-and-play and can be seamlessly
integrated into existing DA frameworks without introducing any additional
trainable parameters. Extensive experiments on three standard DA benchmarks
demonstrate that GALA consistently outperforms prior active learning and active
DA methods, achieving performance comparable to the fully-supervised upperbound
while using only 1% of the target annotations.

Motivation: 现有的深度学习模型在训练数据上表现优异，但在不同传感器或成像条件下的泛化能力不足，限制了其实际应用。作者认为性能下降源于数据分布的差异，需要解决训练与测试分布不一致的问题。

Method: 引入UniPAN方法，构建分布转换函数，将不同来源的数据归一化为相同分布，使模型在统一的分布上训练和测试。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，UniPAN显著提升了深度学习遥感图像融合模型在不同传感器数据上的性能。

Conclusion: UniPAN方法通过统一数据分布，增强了模型的泛化能力，展示了“一次训练，永久部署”的潜力。

Abstract: Existing deep learning-based models for remote sensing pansharpening exhibit
exceptional performance on training datasets. However, due to sensor-specific
characteristics and varying imaging conditions, these models suffer from
substantial performance degradation when applied to unseen satellite data,
lacking generalizability and thus limiting their applicability. We argue that
the performance drops stem primarily from distributional discrepancies from
different sources and the key to addressing this challenge lies in bridging the
gap between training and testing distributions. To validate the idea and
further achieve a "train once, deploy forever" capability, this paper
introduces a novel and intuitive approach to enpower any pansharpening models
with generalizability by employing a unified distribution strategy (UniPAN).
Specifically, we construct a distribution transformation function that
normalizes the pixels sampled from different sources to conform to an identical
distribution. The deep models are trained on the transformed domain, and during
testing on new datasets, the new data are also transformed to match the
training distribution. UniPAN aims to train and test the model on a unified and
consistent distribution, thereby enhancing its generalizability. Extensive
experiments validate the efficacy of UniPAN, demonstrating its potential to
significantly enhance the performance of deep pansharpening models across
diverse satellite sensors. Codes: https://github.com/yc-cui/UniPAN.

Conclusion: 两阶段方法能高效提升低预算语义分割的准确性。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation demands dense pixel-level annotations, which can be
prohibitively expensive - especially under extremely constrained labeling
budgets. In this paper, we address the problem of low-budget active learning
for semantic segmentation by proposing a novel two-stage selection pipeline.
Our approach leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to extract rich
multi-scale features that capture both global structure and fine details. In
the first stage, we perform a hierarchical, representation-based candidate
selection by first choosing a small subset of representative pixels per image
using MaxHerding, and then refining these into a diverse global pool. In the
second stage, we compute an entropy-augmented disagreement score (eDALD) over
noisy multi-scale diffusion features to capture both epistemic uncertainty and
prediction confidence, selecting the most informative pixels for annotation.
This decoupling of diversity and uncertainty lets us achieve high segmentation
accuracy with only a tiny fraction of labeled pixels. Extensive experiments on
four benchmarks (CamVid, ADE-Bed, Cityscapes, and Pascal-Context) demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines under extreme
pixel-budget regimes. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DiffusionLane展现了强大的泛化能力和检测性能，为车道检测任务提供了一种创新且有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel diffusion-based model for lane detection,
called DiffusionLane, which treats the lane detection task as a denoising
diffusion process in the parameter space of the lane. Firstly, we add the
Gaussian noise to the parameters (the starting point and the angle) of ground
truth lanes to obtain noisy lane anchors, and the model learns to refine the
noisy lane anchors in a progressive way to obtain the target lanes. Secondly,
we propose a hybrid decoding strategy to address the poor feature
representation of the encoder, resulting from the noisy lane anchors.
Specifically, we design a hybrid diffusion decoder to combine global-level and
local-level decoders for high-quality lane anchors. Then, to improve the
feature representation of the encoder, we employ an auxiliary head in the
training stage to adopt the learnable lane anchors for enriching the
supervision on the encoder. Experimental results on four benchmarks, Carlane,
Tusimple, CULane, and LLAMAS, show that DiffusionLane possesses a strong
generalization ability and promising detection performance compared to the
previous state-of-the-art methods. For example, DiffusionLane with ResNet18
surpasses the existing methods by at least 1\% accuracy on the domain
adaptation dataset Carlane. Besides, DiffusionLane with MobileNetV4 gets
81.32\% F1 score on CULane, 96.89\% accuracy on Tusimple with ResNet34, and
97.59\% F1 score on LLAMAS with ResNet101. Code will be available at

Conclusion: 通过精确标注和监督的转换，该方法显著提高了事故预测的可靠性，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Accident anticipation aims to predict potential collisions in an online
manner, enabling timely alerts to enhance road safety. Existing methods
typically predict frame-level risk scores as indicators of hazard. However,
these approaches rely on ambiguous binary supervision (labeling all frames in
accident videos as positive) despite the fact that risk varies continuously
over time, leading to unreliable learning and false alarms. To address this, we
propose a novel paradigm that shifts the prediction target from current-frame
risk scoring to directly estimating accident scores at multiple future time
steps (e.g., 0.1s-2.0s ahead), leveraging precisely annotated accident
timestamps as supervision. Our method employs a snippet-level encoder to
jointly model spatial and temporal dynamics, and a Transformer-based temporal
decoder that predicts accident scores for all future horizons simultaneously
using dedicated temporal queries. Furthermore, we introduce a refined
evaluation protocol that reports Time-to-Accident (TTA) and recall (evaluated
at multiple pre-accident intervals (0.5s, 1.0s, and 1.5s)) only when the false
alarm rate (FAR) remains within an acceptable range, ensuring practical
relevance. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in
both recall and TTA under realistic FAR constraints.

Abstract: Large-scale and high-quality image-text pair datasets play an important role
in developing high-performing Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we
introduce WAON, a large-scale and high-quality Japanese image-text pair dataset
containing approximately 155 million examples, collected from Common Crawl. Our

using both WAON and the Japanese subset of ReLAION, one of the most widely used
vision-language datasets. We fine-tune SigLIP2, a strong multilingual model, on
both datasets. The results demonstrate that WAON enhances model performance on
WAON-Bench more efficiently than ReLAION and achieves higher accuracy across
all evaluated benchmarks. Furthermore, the model fine-tuned on WAON achieves

Abstract: Harnessing publicly available, large-scale web data, such as street view and
satellite imagery, urban socio-economic sensing is of paramount importance for
achieving global sustainable development goals. With the emergence of Large
Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), new opportunities have arisen to solve this
task by treating it as a multi-modal perception and understanding problem.
However, recent studies reveal that LVLMs still struggle with accurate and
interpretable socio-economic predictions from visual data. To address these
limitations and maximize the potential of LVLMs, we introduce
\textbf{CityRiSE}, a novel framework for \textbf{R}eason\textbf{i}ng urban
\textbf{S}ocio-\textbf{E}conomic status in LVLMs through pure reinforcement
learning (RL). With carefully curated multi-modal data and verifiable reward
design, our approach guides the LVLM to focus on semantically meaningful visual
cues, enabling structured and goal-oriented reasoning for generalist
socio-economic status prediction. Experiments demonstrate that CityRiSE with
emergent reasoning process significantly outperforms existing baselines,
improving both prediction accuracy and generalization across diverse urban
contexts, particularly for prediction on unseen cities and unseen indicators.
This work highlights the promise of combining RL and LVLMs for interpretable
and generalist urban socio-economic sensing.

Motivation: 现有扩散方法将fMRI活动映射为单一的高级嵌入，忽略了分层神经信息与图像重建的阶段需求之间的不匹配问题。MindHier旨在通过层次化重构解决这一问题。

Method: MindHier包含三个核心组件：分层fMRI编码器提取多级神经嵌入，层次对齐方案确保层间对应关系，以及尺度感知的从粗到细神经引导策略，将嵌入注入匹配尺度的自回归过程中。

Result: 在NSD数据集上，MindHier在语义保真度、推理速度（快4.67倍）和结果确定性方面均优于扩散基准方法。

Conclusion: MindHier通过层次化重构过程，实现了高效且符合认知的图像重建，为跨领域研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Reconstructing visual stimuli from fMRI signals is a central challenge
bridging machine learning and neuroscience. Recent diffusion-based methods
typically map fMRI activity to a single high-level embedding, using it as fixed
guidance throughout the entire generation process. However, this fixed guidance
collapses hierarchical neural information and is misaligned with the
stage-dependent demands of image reconstruction. In response, we propose
MindHier, a coarse-to-fine fMRI-to-image reconstruction framework built on
scale-wise autoregressive modeling. MindHier introduces three components: a
Hierarchical fMRI Encoder to extract multi-level neural embeddings, a
Hierarchy-to-Hierarchy Alignment scheme to enforce layer-wise correspondence
with CLIP features, and a Scale-Aware Coarse-to-Fine Neural Guidance strategy
to inject these embeddings into autoregression at matching scales. These
designs make MindHier an efficient and cognitively-aligned alternative to
diffusion-based methods by enabling a hierarchical reconstruction process that
synthesizes global semantics before refining local details, akin to human
visual perception. Extensive experiments on the NSD dataset show that MindHier
achieves superior semantic fidelity, 4.67x faster inference, and more
deterministic results than the diffusion-based baselines.

Abstract: Precise geometric control in image generation is essential for engineering \&

GeoDiffusion, a training-free framework for accurate and efficient geometric
conditioning of 3D features in image generation. GeoDiffusion employs a
class-specific 3D object as a geometric prior to define keypoints and
parametric correlations in 3D space. We ensure viewpoint consistency through a
rendered image of a reference 3D object, followed by style transfer to meet
user-defined appearance specifications. At the core of our framework is
GeoDrag, improving accuracy and speed of drag-based image editing on geometry
guidance tasks and general instructions on DragBench. Our results demonstrate
that GeoDiffusion enables precise geometric modifications across various

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Deformable image registration estimates voxel-wise correspondences between
images through spatial transformations, and plays a key role in medical
imaging. While deep learning methods have significantly reduced runtime,
efficiently handling large deformations remains a challenging task.
Convolutional networks aggregate local features but lack direct modeling of
voxel correspondences, promoting recent works to explore explicit feature
matching. Among them, voxel-to-region matching is more efficient for direct
correspondence modeling by computing local correlation features whithin
neighbourhoods, while region-to-region matching incurs higher redundancy due to
excessive correlation pairs across large regions. However, the inherent
locality of voxel-to-region matching hinders the capture of long-range
correspondences required for large deformations. To address this, we propose a
Recurrent Correlation-based framework that dynamically relocates the matching
region toward more promising positions. At each step, local matching is
performed with low cost, and the estimated offset guides the next search
region, supporting efficient convergence toward large deformations. In
addition, we uses a lightweight recurrent update module with memory capacity
and decouples motion-related and texture features to suppress semantic
redundancy. We conduct extensive experiments on brain MRI and abdominal CT
datasets under two settings: with and without affine pre-registration. Results
show that our method exibits a strong accuracy-computation trade-off,
surpassing or matching the state-of-the-art performance. For example, it
achieves comparable performance on the non-affine OASIS dataset, while using
only 9.5% of the FLOPs and running 96% faster than RDP, a representative
high-performing method.

Conclusion: TDSR作为一种即插即用模块，能够在不损失规划质量的情况下高效优化视觉语言模型的生成能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) face an inherent contradiction in image
captioning: their powerful single-step generation capabilities often lead to a
myopic decision-making process. This makes it difficult to maintain global
narrative coherence while capturing rich details, a limitation that is
particularly pronounced in tasks that require multi-step and complex scene
description. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we redefine image
captioning as a goal-oriented hierarchical refinement planning problem, and
further propose a novel framework, named Top-Down Semantic Refinement (TDSR),
which models the generation process as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
However, planning within the vast state space of a VLM presents a significant
computational hurdle. Our core contribution, therefore, is the design of a
highly efficient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm tailored for VLMs. By
incorporating a visual-guided parallel expansion and a lightweight value
network, our TDSR reduces the call frequency to the expensive VLM by an order
of magnitude without sacrificing planning quality. Furthermore, an adaptive
early stopping mechanism dynamically matches computational overhead to the
image's complexity. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, including
DetailCaps, COMPOSITIONCAP, and POPE, demonstrate that our TDSR, as a
plug-and-play module, can significantly enhance the performance of existing
VLMs (e.g., LLaVA-1.5, Qwen2.5-VL) by achieving state-of-the-art or highly
competitive results in fine-grained description, compositional generalization,
and hallucination suppression.

Abstract: Because 3D structure of a roadway environment can be characterized directly
by a Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors, they can be used to obtain
exceptional situational awareness for assitive and autonomous driving systems.
Although LiDARs demonstrate good performance in clean and clear weather
conditions, their performance significantly deteriorates in adverse weather
conditions such as those involving atmospheric precipitation. This may render
perception capabilities of autonomous systems that use LiDAR data in learning
based models to perform object detection and ranging ineffective. While efforts
have been made to enhance the accuracy of these models, the extent of signal
degradation under various weather conditions remains largely not quantified. In
this study, we focus on the performance of an automotive grade LiDAR in snowy
conditions in order to develop a physics-based model that examines failure
modes of a LiDAR sensor. Specifically, we investigated how the LiDAR signal
attenuates with different snowfall rates and how snow particles near the source
serve as small but efficient reflectors. Utilizing our model, we transform data
from clear conditions to simulate snowy scenarios, enabling a comparison of our
synthetic data with actual snowy conditions. Furthermore, we employ this
synthetic data, representative of different snowfall rates, to explore the
impact on a pre-trained object detection model, assessing its performance under
varying levels of snowfall

work, we consider the important complementary problem of inferring that goal
from multi-modal contextual observations. Solving this "goal inference" problem
holds the promise of eliminating the effort needed to interact with such an
agent. This work focuses on creating WAGIBench, a strong benchmark to measure
progress in solving this problem using vision-language models (VLMs). Given the
limited prior work in this area, we collected a novel dataset comprising 29
hours of multimodal data from 348 participants across 3,477 recordings,
featuring ground-truth goals alongside accompanying visual, audio, digital, and
longitudinal contextual observations. We validate that human performance
exceeds model performance, achieving 93% multiple-choice accuracy compared with
84% for the best-performing VLM. Generative benchmark results that evaluate
several families of modern vision-language models show that larger models
perform significantly better on the task, yet remain far from practical
usefulness, as they produce relevant goals only 55% of the time. Through a
modality ablation, we show that models benefit from extra information in
relevant modalities with minimal performance degradation from irrelevant
modalities.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种高效的半监督学习框架，用于从冷冻电子断层扫描（CryoET）数据中定位和分类蛋白质，解决了现有方法依赖耗时手动标注的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CryoET技术中，蛋白质定位和分类（粒子拾取）依赖大量手动标注，限制了未标注数据的利用。本文旨在通过半监督学习高效利用这些数据。

Method: 方法包括：（1）基于热图监督的端到端检测模型；（2）教师-学生协同训练机制；（3）多视角伪标注和CryoET专用DropBlock增强策略。

Result: 在CZII数据集上的实验表明，该方法比监督基线提升了10%的F1分数。

Conclusion: 半监督学习能有效利用未标注CryoET数据，为蛋白质结构研究提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Cryogenic Electron Tomography (CryoET) combined with sub-volume averaging
(SVA) is the only imaging modality capable of resolving protein structures
inside cells at molecular resolution. Particle picking, the task of localizing
and classifying target proteins in 3D CryoET volumes, remains the main
bottleneck. Due to the reliance on time-consuming manual labels, the vast
reserve of unlabeled tomograms remains underutilized. In this work, we present
a fast, label-efficient semi-supervised framework that exploits this untapped
data. Our framework consists of two components: (i) an end-to-end
heatmap-supervised detection model inspired by keypoint detection, and (ii) a
teacher-student co-training mechanism that enhances performance under sparse
labeling conditions. Furthermore, we introduce multi-view pseudo-labeling and a
CryoET-specific DropBlock augmentation strategy to further boost performance.
Extensive evaluations on the large-scale CZII dataset show that our approach
improves F1 by 10% over supervised baselines, underscoring the promise of
semi-supervised learning for leveraging unlabeled CryoET data.

TL;DR: DynaPose4D提出了一种创新的解决方案，通过结合4D高斯飞溅技术和类别无关姿态估计技术，从单一静态图像生成高质量的4D动态内容，解决了传统方法在建模时间依赖性和捕捉动态几何变化方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以从单一静态图像生成高质量的4D动态内容，尤其是在建模时间依赖性和捕捉动态几何变化方面存在不足。

Method: DynaPose4D结合4D高斯飞溅技术和类别无关姿态估计技术，利用3D高斯飞溅从单一图像构建3D模型，并通过一次性支持视图预测多视角姿态关键点，利用监督信号增强运动一致性。

Result: 实验结果表明，DynaPose4D在动态运动生成中表现出卓越的连贯性和流畅性。

Conclusion: DynaPose4D不仅验证了其框架的有效性，还展示了在计算机视觉和动画制作领域的潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D and 3D generative models have expanded the
capabilities of computer vision. However, generating high-quality 4D dynamic
content from a single static image remains a significant challenge. Traditional
methods have limitations in modeling temporal dependencies and accurately
capturing dynamic geometry changes, especially when considering variations in
camera perspective. To address this issue, we propose DynaPose4D, an innovative
solution that integrates 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) techniques with
Category-Agnostic Pose Estimation (CAPE) technology. This framework uses 3D
Gaussian Splatting to construct a 3D model from single images, then predicts
multi-view pose keypoints based on one-shot support from a chosen view,
leveraging supervisory signals to enhance motion consistency. Experimental
results show that DynaPose4D achieves excellent coherence, consistency, and
fluidity in dynamic motion generation. These findings not only validate the
efficacy of the DynaPose4D framework but also indicate its potential
applications in the domains of computer vision and animation production.

TL;DR: AesCrop是一个结合了VMamba编码器和MCAB的新型图像裁剪模型，通过显式编码构图线索，生成了多样化的高质量裁剪结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美观的图像裁剪对用户吸引力很重要，现有方法在全局性和多样性上存在不足，且缺乏构图指导。AesCrop旨在填补这一空白。

Method: AesCrop整合了VMamba编码器和MCAB注意力偏差，通过变换器解码器实现端到端基于排名的裁剪，生成多种裁剪及评分。

Result: 实验证明AesCrop在定量和定性上均优于现有最佳方法，提供了更吸引人的裁剪结果。

Conclusion: AesCrop通过显式编码构图指导，提升了裁剪的多样性和质量，表现优于现有方法。

Abstract: Aesthetic-driven image cropping is crucial for applications like view
recommendation and thumbnail generation, where visual appeal significantly
impacts user engagement. A key factor in visual appeal is composition--the
deliberate arrangement of elements within an image. Some methods have
successfully incorporated compositional knowledge through evaluation-based and
regression-based paradigms. However, evaluation-based methods lack globality
while regression-based methods lack diversity. Recently, hybrid approaches that
integrate both paradigms have emerged, bridging the gap between these two to
achieve better diversity and globality. Notably, existing hybrid methods do not
incorporate photographic composition guidance, a key attribute that defines
photographic aesthetics. In this work, we introduce AesCrop, a
composition-aware hybrid image-cropping model that integrates a VMamba image
encoder, augmented with a novel Mamba Composition Attention Bias (MCAB) and a
transformer decoder to perform end-to-end rank-based image cropping, generating
multiple crops along with the corresponding quality scores. By explicitly
encoding compositional cues into the attention mechanism, MCAB directs AesCrop
to focus on the most compositionally salient regions. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that AesCrop outperforms current state-of-the-art methods,
delivering superior quantitative metrics and qualitatively more pleasing crops.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为BoWG的新型闭环检测方法，通过引入词组和时空一致性，显著提高了在感知混淆环境中的检测精度、鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于传统方法在感知混淆环境（如狭窄管道）中表现不佳，且现有解决方案计算成本高，因此需要一种更高效、更稳健的闭环检测方法。

Method: BoWG通过词组捕捉视觉词的空间共现和接近性，构建在线字典，并结合自适应方案直接在相似性计算中引入时间一致性，辅以特征分布分析和后验证机制。

Result: 实验结果表明，BoWG在公共数据集和自制受限管道数据集上均优于现有方法（包括传统和基于学习的方法），且在Bicocca25b数据集上平均每幅图像处理时间仅为16毫秒。

Conclusion: BoWG在闭环检测中展现出卓越的精度、鲁棒性和计算效率，适用于复杂的感知混淆环境。

Abstract: Loop closure is critical in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
systems to reduce accumulative drift and ensure global mapping consistency.
However, conventional methods struggle in perceptually aliased environments,
such as narrow pipes, due to vector quantization, feature sparsity, and
repetitive textures, while existing solutions often incur high computational
costs. This paper presents Bag-of-Word-Groups (BoWG), a novel loop closure
detection method that achieves superior precision-recall, robustness, and
computational efficiency. The core innovation lies in the introduction of word
groups, which captures the spatial co-occurrence and proximity of visual words
to construct an online dictionary. Additionally, drawing inspiration from
probabilistic transition models, we incorporate temporal consistency directly
into similarity computation with an adaptive scheme, substantially improving
precision-recall performance. The method is further strengthened by a feature
distribution analysis module and dedicated post-verification mechanisms. To
evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we conduct experiments on both public
datasets and a confined-pipe dataset we constructed. Results demonstrate that
BoWG surpasses state-of-the-art methods, including both traditional and
learning-based approaches, in terms of precision-recall and computational
efficiency. Our approach also exhibits excellent scalability, achieving an
average processing time of 16 ms per image across 17,565 images in the
Bicocca25b dataset.

*Chen Chen,Majid Abdolshah,Violetta Shevchenko,Hongdong Li,Chang Xu,Pulak Purkait*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 为了解决现有基于扩散的超分辨率方法中的语义模糊问题，研究提出了一种新的插拔式空间重聚焦框架（SRSR），包含空间重聚焦交叉注意力（SRCA）和空间定向无分类器指导（STCFG），显著提高了语义保真度和感知质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法因文本条件不准确和不完整，以及交叉注意力偏向无关像素，导致输出中存在语义错位和幻觉细节。

Method: 提出了SRSR框架，包括SRCA（通过视觉分割掩模引导交叉注意力）和STCFG（选择性绕过未接地像素的文本影响）。

Result: 实验表明，SRSR在PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS和DISTS等指标上优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: SRSR框架在超分辨率任务中实现了高语义保真度和感知质量。

Abstract: Existing diffusion-based super-resolution approaches often exhibit semantic
ambiguities due to inaccuracies and incompleteness in their text conditioning,
coupled with the inherent tendency for cross-attention to divert towards
irrelevant pixels. These limitations can lead to semantic misalignment and
hallucinated details in the generated high-resolution outputs. To address
these, we propose a novel, plug-and-play spatially re-focused super-resolution
(SRSR) framework that consists of two core components: first, we introduce
Spatially Re-focused Cross-Attention (SRCA), which refines text conditioning at
inference time by applying visually-grounded segmentation masks to guide
cross-attention. Second, we introduce a Spatially Targeted Classifier-Free
Guidance (STCFG) mechanism that selectively bypasses text influences on
ungrounded pixels to prevent hallucinations. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that SRSR consistently
outperforms seven state-of-the-art baselines in standard fidelity metrics (PSNR
and SSIM) across all datasets, and in perceptual quality measures (LPIPS and
DISTS) on two real-world benchmarks, underscoring its effectiveness in
achieving both high semantic fidelity and perceptual quality in
super-resolution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文介绍了STATUS Bench和Train，首个用于评估和提升视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在物体状态识别能力的基准和数据集，揭示了当前VLMs在此任务上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然VLMs在多模态任务上表现出色，但其在物体状态识别（如位置和功能状态）的精确度尚不明确，因此需要一个专门的基准和数据集来评估和提升这一能力。

Method: 提出STATUS Bench基准，包含三个任务（OSI、IR、SCI），基于手工制作的图像对和描述；同时推出STATUS Train训练数据集（1300万半自动生成描述）。

Result: 实验表明当前VLMs在STATUS Bench上表现不佳，多数模型零样本性能接近随机水平；经STATUS Train微调后，Qwen2.5-VL达到与Gemini 2.0 Flash相当的水平。

Conclusion: STATUS Bench和Train对推动VLM在物体状态识别研究至关重要，揭示了现有模型的局限性并提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Object state recognition aims to identify the specific condition of objects,
such as their positional states (e.g., open or closed) and functional states
(e.g., on or off). While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are capable of
performing a variety of multimodal tasks, it remains unclear how precisely they
can identify object states. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the STAte and
Transition UnderStanding Benchmark (STATUS Bench), the first benchmark for
rigorously evaluating the ability of VLMs to understand subtle variations in
object states in diverse situations. Specifically, STATUS Bench introduces a
novel evaluation scheme that requires VLMs to perform three tasks
simultaneously: object state identification (OSI), image retrieval (IR), and
state change identification (SCI). These tasks are defined over our fully
hand-crafted dataset involving image pairs, their corresponding object state
descriptions and state change descriptions. Furthermore, we introduce a
large-scale training dataset, namely STATUS Train, which consists of 13 million
semi-automatically created descriptions. This dataset serves as the largest
resource to facilitate further research in this area. In our experiments, we
demonstrate that STATUS Bench enables rigorous consistency evaluation and
reveal that current state-of-the-art VLMs still significantly struggle to
capture subtle object state distinctions. Surprisingly, under the proposed
rigorous evaluation scheme, most open-weight VLMs exhibited chance-level
zero-shot performance. After fine-tuning on STATUS Train, Qwen2.5-VL achieved
performance comparable to Gemini 2.0 Flash. These findings underscore the
necessity of STATUS Bench and Train for advancing object state recognition in
VLM research.

Method: 提出三个贡献：首个专注于自然对话场景的微表情数据集；端到端的定位和检测框架MELDAE；新的边界感知损失函数以提高时间精度。

Result: 在WDMD数据集上取得了最先进的结果，F1_{DR}定位指标比最强基线提高了17.72%，并在现有基准上展示了优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了真实场景中微表情分析的挑战，为实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Accurately analyzing spontaneous, unconscious micro-expressions is crucial
for revealing true human emotions, but this task remains challenging in wild
scenarios, such as natural conversation. Existing research largely relies on
datasets from controlled laboratory environments, and their performance
degrades dramatically in the real world. To address this issue, we propose
three contributions: the first micro-expression dataset focused on
conversational-in-the-wild scenarios; an end-to-end localization and detection
framework, MELDAE; and a novel boundary-aware loss function that improves
temporal accuracy by penalizing onset and offset errors. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework achieves state-of-the-art results on the WDMD
dataset, improving the key F1_{DR} localization metric by 17.72% over the
strongest baseline, while also demonstrating excellent generalization
capabilities on existing benchmarks.

Motivation: XLFM在神经科学中具有单次曝光体积成像、宽视场和高时间分辨率等优势，但其3D重建仍因缺乏标准化数据集和高效建模方法而受限。

Method: 1. 构建XLFM-Zebrafish基准数据集；2. 提出自监督任务MVN-LF以学习角度先验；3. 设计ORC Loss确保预测体积与PSF前向投影一致。

Result: 在XLFM-Zebrafish基准上，方法将PSNR提升了7.7%，优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 三项贡献有效解决了XLFM重建的挑战，提升了性能，为神经影像学提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Light field microscopy (LFM) has become an emerging tool in neuroscience for
large-scale neural imaging in vivo, notable for its single-exposure volumetric
imaging, broad field of view, and high temporal resolution. However,
learning-based 3D reconstruction in XLFM remains underdeveloped due to two core
challenges: the absence of standardized datasets and the lack of methods that
can efficiently model its angular-spatial structure while remaining physically
grounded. We address these challenges by introducing three key contributions.
First, we construct the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, a large-scale dataset and
evaluation suite for XLFM reconstruction. Second, we propose Masked View
Modeling for Light Fields (MVN-LF), a self-supervised task that learns angular
priors by predicting occluded views, improving data efficiency. Third, we
formulate the Optical Rendering Consistency Loss (ORC Loss), a differentiable
rendering constraint that enforces alignment between predicted volumes and
their PSF-based forward projections. On the XLFM-Zebrafish benchmark, our
method improves PSNR by 7.7% over state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization (CVGL) enables UAV localization by matching
aerial images to geo-tagged satellite databases, which is critical for
autonomous navigation in GNSS-denied environments. However, existing methods
rely on resource-intensive fine-grained feature extraction and alignment, where
multiple branches and modules significantly increase inference costs, limiting
their deployment on edge devices. We propose Precision-Focused Efficient Design
(PFED), a resource-efficient framework combining hierarchical knowledge
transfer and multi-view representation refinement. This innovative method
comprises two key components: 1) During training, Hierarchical Distillation
paradigm for fast and accurate CVGL (HD-CVGL), coupled with Uncertainty-Aware
Prediction Alignment (UAPA) to distill essential information and mitigate the
data imbalance without incurring additional inference overhead. 2) During
inference, an efficient Multi-view Refinement Module (MRM) leverages mutual
information to filter redundant samples and effectively utilize the multi-view
data. Extensive experiments show that PFED achieves state-of-the-art
performance in both accuracy and efficiency, reaching 97.15\% Recall@1 on
University-1652 while being over $5 \times$ more efficient in FLOPs and $3
\times$ faster than previous top methods. Furthermore, PFED runs at 251.5 FPS
on the AGX Orin edge device, demonstrating its practical viability for
real-time UAV applications. The project is available at

Motivation: CT图像从不完整的投影数据中重建是一个挑战，现有方法在数据一致性方面仍有不足。

Method: 提出了PEDB模型，通过引入新的反向随机微分方程，嵌入投影数据并控制随机性水平，改进了离散化方案。

Result: 实验表明PEDB在多种不完整数据重建任务中表现优异，超越了现有方法。

Conclusion: PEDB通过显式结合数据一致性，显著提升了CT重建的效果。

Abstract: Reconstructing CT images from incomplete projection data remains challenging
due to the ill-posed nature of the problem. Diffusion bridge models have
recently shown promise in restoring clean images from their corresponding
Filtered Back Projection (FBP) reconstructions, but incorporating data
consistency into these models remains largely underexplored. Incorporating data
consistency can improve reconstruction fidelity by aligning the reconstructed
image with the observed projection data, and can enhance detail recovery by
integrating structural information contained in the projections. In this work,
we propose the Projection Embedded Diffusion Bridge (PEDB). PEDB introduces a
novel reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) to sample from the
distribution of clean images conditioned on both the FBP reconstruction and the
incomplete projection data. By explicitly conditioning on the projection data
in sampling the clean images, PEDB naturally incorporates data consistency. We
embed the projection data into the score function of the reverse SDE. Under
certain assumptions, we derive a tractable expression for the posterior score.
In addition, we introduce a free parameter to control the level of
stochasticity in the reverse process. We also design a discretization scheme
for the reverse SDE to mitigate discretization error. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PEDB achieves strong performance in CT reconstruction from
three types of incomplete data, including sparse-view, limited-angle, and
truncated projections. For each of these types, PEDB outperforms evaluated
state-of-the-art diffusion bridge models across standard, noisy, and
domain-shift evaluations.

Conclusion: 跨物种迁移学习受限于合成与真实数据的领域差异,研究呼吁优先考虑农业AI设计,注重农场级真实性和跨环境鲁棒性。

Abstract: Pose estimation serves as a cornerstone of computer vision for understanding
animal posture, behavior, and welfare. Yet, agricultural applications remain
constrained by the scarcity of large, annotated datasets for livestock,
especially dairy cattle. This study evaluates the potential and limitations of
cross-species transfer learning by adapting ZebraPose - a vision
transformer-based model trained on synthetic zebra imagery - for 27-keypoint
detection in dairy cows under real barn conditions. Using three configurations
- a custom on-farm dataset (375 images, Sussex, New Brunswick, Canada), a
subset of the APT-36K benchmark dataset, and their combination, we
systematically assessed model accuracy and generalization across environments.
While the combined model achieved promising performance (AP = 0.86, AR = 0.87,
PCK 0.5 = 0.869) on in-distribution data, substantial generalization failures
occurred when applied to unseen barns and cow populations. These findings
expose the synthetic-to-real domain gap as a major obstacle to agricultural AI
deployment and emphasize that morphological similarity between species is
insufficient for cross-domain transfer. The study provides practical insights
into dataset diversity, environmental variability, and computational
constraints that influence real-world deployment of livestock monitoring
systems. We conclude with a call for agriculture-first AI design, prioritizing
farm-level realism, cross-environment robustness, and open benchmark datasets
to advance trustworthy and scalable animal-centric technologies.

model demonstrates strong generalization under scanner and staining shifts,
achieving balanced accuracy 85.0%, AUROC 0.927, sensitivity 89.2%, and

combining DenseNet-121 with stain-aware augmentation and imbalance-adaptive

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SARCLIP-1M是一个大规模视觉语言数据集，包含超过一百万个文本图像对，研究人员还提出了SARCLIP模型，通过对比学习方法在SAR领域取得了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督学习和掩蔽图像建模方法在SAR图像中主要关注低级视觉特征，忽视了多模态对齐和零样本目标识别，因此需要一种新的方法来弥补这一不足。

Method: 研究人员构建了SARCLIP-1M数据集，并提出了SARCLIP模型，采用对比视觉语言学习和域转移策略，以弥合SAR图像与文本描述之间的差距。

Result: SARCLIP在图像文本检索和零样本分类任务中表现出色，显著优于现有技术，提升了SAR图像的语义理解能力。

Conclusion: SARCLIP模型通过多模态对齐和对比学习方法，为SAR领域提供了首个视觉语言基础模型，推动了SAR图像的语义理解。

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) has emerged as a crucial imaging modality due
to its all-weather capabilities. While recent advancements in self-supervised
learning and Masked Image Modeling (MIM) have paved the way for SAR foundation
models, these approaches primarily focus on low-level visual features, often
overlooking multimodal alignment and zero-shot target recognition within SAR
imagery. To address this limitation, we construct SARCLIP-1M, a large-scale
vision language dataset comprising over one million text-image pairs aggregated
from existing datasets. We further introduce SARCLIP, the first vision language
foundation model tailored for the SAR domain. Our SARCLIP model is trained
using a contrastive vision language learning approach by domain transferring
strategy, enabling it to bridge the gap between SAR imagery and textual
descriptions. Extensive experiments on image-text retrieval and zero-shot
classification tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SARCLIP in feature
extraction and interpretation, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art
foundation models and advancing the semantic understanding of SAR imagery. The
code and datasets will be released soon.

TL;DR: LVD-GS是一个结合LiDAR和视觉的3D高斯泼溅SLAM系统，通过分层协作表示模块和动态建模模块，解决了大规模动态室外场景中的尺度漂移和动态对象干扰问题。


<details>

Motivation: 现有SLAM方法在大型动态室外场景中表现受限，存在累积位姿误差和尺度模糊问题。

Method: 提出分层协作表示模块优化映射，引入联合动态建模模块生成动态掩模。

Result: 在KITTI、nuScenes和自采数据集上取得最先进性能。

Conclusion: LVD-GS有效解决了动态场景中的SLAM挑战，提升了重建鲁棒性。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM has emerged as a widely used technique for
high-fidelity mapping in spatial intelligence. However, existing methods often
rely on a single representation scheme, which limits their performance in
large-scale dynamic outdoor scenes and leads to cumulative pose errors and
scale ambiguity. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{LVD-GS}, a
novel LiDAR-Visual 3D Gaussian Splatting SLAM system. Motivated by the human
chain-of-thought process for information seeking, we introduce a hierarchical
collaborative representation module that facilitates mutual reinforcement for
mapping optimization, effectively mitigating scale drift and enhancing
reconstruction robustness. Furthermore, to effectively eliminate the influence
of dynamic objects, we propose a joint dynamic modeling module that generates
fine-grained dynamic masks by fusing open-world segmentation with implicit
residual constraints, guided by uncertainty estimates from DINO-Depth features.
Extensive evaluations on KITTI, nuScenes, and self-collected datasets
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to
existing methods.

Abstract: Structural fireproof classification is vital for disaster risk assessment and
insurance pricing in Japan. However, key building metadata such as construction
year and structure type are often missing or outdated, particularly in the
second-hand housing market. This study proposes a multi-task learning model
that predicts these attributes from facade images. The model jointly estimates
the construction year, building structure, and property type, from which the
structural fireproof class - defined as H (non-fireproof), T (semi-fireproof),
or M (fireproof) - is derived via a rule-based mapping based on official
insurance criteria. We trained and evaluated the model using a large-scale
dataset of Japanese residential images, applying rigorous filtering and
deduplication. The model achieved high accuracy in construction-year regression
and robust classification across imbalanced categories. Qualitative analyses
show that it captures visual cues related to building age and materials. Our
approach demonstrates the feasibility of scalable, interpretable, image-based
risk-profiling systems, offering potential applications in insurance, urban
planning, and disaster preparedness.

Abstract: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are fundamental to digital design and robot
control, encoding not only visual structure but also motion paths in
interactive drawings. In this work, we introduce RoboSVG, a unified multimodal
framework for generating interactive SVGs guided by textual, visual, and
numerical signals. Given an input query, the RoboSVG model first produces
multimodal guidance, then synthesizes candidate SVGs through dedicated
generation modules, and finally refines them under numerical guidance to yield
high-quality outputs. To support this framework, we construct RoboDraw, a
large-scale dataset of one million examples, each pairing an SVG generation
condition (e.g., text, image, and partial SVG) with its corresponding
ground-truth SVG code. RoboDraw dataset enables systematic study of four tasks,
including basic generation (Text-to-SVG, Image-to-SVG) and interactive
generation (PartialSVG-to-SVG, PartialImage-to-SVG). Extensive experiments
demonstrate that RoboSVG achieves superior query compliance and visual fidelity
across tasks, establishing a new state of the art in versatile SVG generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VADTree是一种基于分层粒度感知树（HGTree）的视频异常检测方法，通过利用预训练模型的通用事件边界检测能力，实现灵活的采样和多粒度异常评分整合，显著减少采样段数并达到最佳性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监督方法需要大量领域内训练数据且难以解释异常，而现有训练无关方法因固定长度时间窗口采样难以捕捉不同时间跨度的异常。

Method: VADTree使用HGTree结构，通过预训练的GEBD模型分解视频为通用事件节点，进行自适应分层结构和冗余去除，并将多维先验注入视觉语言模型和大型语言模型进行异常感知和推理。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，VADTree在训练无关设置中表现最佳，同时大幅减少采样段数。

Conclusion: VADTree通过灵活的采样和多粒度整合，有效解决视频异常检测中的时间跨度问题，显著提升性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) focuses on identifying anomalies in videos.
Supervised methods demand substantial in-domain training data and fail to
deliver clear explanations for anomalies. In contrast, training-free methods
leverage the knowledge reserves and language interactivity of large pre-trained
models to detect anomalies. However, the current fixed-length temporal window
sampling approaches struggle to accurately capture anomalies with varying
temporal spans. Therefore, we propose VADTree that utilizes a Hierarchical
Granularityaware Tree (HGTree) structure for flexible sampling in VAD. VADTree
leverages the knowledge embedded in a pre-trained Generic Event Boundary
Detection (GEBD) model to characterize potential anomaly event boundaries.
Specifically, VADTree decomposes the video into generic event nodes based on
boundary confidence, and performs adaptive coarse-fine hierarchical structuring
and redundancy removal to construct the HGTree. Then, the multi-dimensional
priors are injected into the visual language models (VLMs) to enhance the
node-wise anomaly perception, and anomaly reasoning for generic event nodes is
achieved via large language models (LLMs). Finally, an inter-cluster node
correlation method is used to integrate the multi-granularity anomaly scores.
Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate that VADTree
achieves state-of-the-art performance in training-free settings while
drastically reducing the number of sampled video segments. The code will be
available at https://github.com/wenlongli10/VADTree.

Result: 实验显示，方法显著提升了生成质量17.07%，同时减少了8.95%的检索次数。

Conclusion: 提出的动态检索和自适应训练策略有效解决了多模态检索增强生成中的关键问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) has emerged as a promising
method to generate factual and up-to-date responses of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) by incorporating non-parametric knowledge from external
knowledge bases. However, existing MRAG approaches suffer from static retrieval
strategies, inflexible modality selection, and suboptimal utilization of
retrieved information, leading to three critical challenges: determining when
to retrieve, what modality to incorporate, and how to utilize retrieved
information effectively. To address these challenges, we introduce Windsock, a
query-dependent module making decisions on retrieval necessity and modality
selection, effectively reducing computational overhead and improving response
quality. Additionally, we propose Dynamic Noise-Resistance (DANCE) Instruction
Tuning, an adaptive training strategy that enhances MLLMs' ability to utilize
retrieved information while maintaining robustness against noise. Moreover, we
adopt a self-assessment approach leveraging knowledge within MLLMs to convert
question-answering datasets to MRAG training datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves the generation
quality by 17.07% while reducing 8.95% retrieval times.

Conclusion: WaveMAE是一个高效且地理感知的遥感基础模型，适用于多光谱图像的多项任务。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a key strategy for
building foundation models in remote sensing, where the scarcity of annotated
data limits the applicability of fully supervised approaches. In this work, we
introduce WaveMAE, a masked autoencoding framework tailored for multispectral
satellite imagery. Unlike conventional pixel-based reconstruction, WaveMAE
leverages a multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to disentangle
frequency components and guide the encoder toward learning scale-aware
high-frequency representations. We further propose a Geo-conditioned Positional
Encoding (GPE), which incorporates geographical priors via Spherical Harmonics,
encouraging embeddings that respect both semantic and geospatial structure. To
ensure fairness in evaluation, all methods are pretrained on the same dataset
(fMoW-S2) and systematically evaluated on the diverse downstream tasks of the
PANGAEA benchmark, spanning semantic segmentation, regression, change
detection, and multilabel classification. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that WaveMAE achieves consistent improvements over prior state-of-the-art
approaches, with substantial gains on segmentation and regression benchmarks.
The effectiveness of WaveMAE pretraining is further demonstrated by showing
that even a lightweight variant, containing only 26.4% of the parameters,
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our results establish WaveMAE as a
strong and geographically informed foundation model for multispectral remote
sensing imagery.

Abstract: Humans naturally perceive the geometric structure and semantic content of a
3D world as intertwined dimensions, enabling coherent and accurate
understanding of complex scenes. However, most prior approaches prioritize
training large geometry models for low-level 3D reconstruction and treat
high-level spatial understanding in isolation, overlooking the crucial
interplay between these two fundamental aspects of 3D-scene analysis, thereby
limiting generalization and leading to poor performance in downstream 3D
understanding tasks. Recent attempts have mitigated this issue by simply
aligning 3D models with specific language models, thus restricting perception
to the aligned model's capacity and limiting adaptability to downstream tasks.
In this paper, we propose InstanceGrounded Geometry Transformer (IGGT), an
end-to-end large unified transformer to unify the knowledge for both spatial
reconstruction and instance-level contextual understanding. Specifically, we
design a 3D-Consistent Contrastive Learning strategy that guides IGGT to encode
a unified representation with geometric structures and instance-grounded
clustering through only 2D visual inputs. This representation supports
consistent lifting of 2D visual inputs into a coherent 3D scene with explicitly
distinct object instances. To facilitate this task, we further construct
InsScene-15K, a large-scale dataset with high-quality RGB images, poses, depth
maps, and 3D-consistent instance-level mask annotations with a novel data
curation pipeline.

word-level lipreading dataset, comprising $743$ target words and over
$414{,}000$ video samples extracted from more than $1{,}900$ hours of footage
across $67$ television programs. Designed as a benchmark-ready resource,
LRW-Persian provides speaker-disjoint training and test splits, wide regional

end-to-end curation pipeline encompassing transcription based on Automatic
Speech Recognition(ASR), active-speaker localization, quality filtering, and
pose/mask screening. We further fine-tune two widely used lipreading
architectures on LRW-Persian, establishing reference performance and
demonstrating the difficulty of Persian visual speech recognition. By filling a

Abstract: Cross-view localization and synthesis are two fundamental tasks in cross-view
visual understanding, which deals with cross-view datasets: overhead (satellite
or aerial) and ground-level imagery. These tasks have gained increasing
attention due to their broad applications in autonomous navigation, urban
planning, and augmented reality. Cross-view localization aims to estimate the
geographic position of ground-level images based on information provided by
overhead imagery while cross-view synthesis seeks to generate ground-level
images based on information from the overhead imagery. Both tasks remain
challenging due to significant differences in viewing perspective, resolution,
and occlusion, which are widely embedded in cross-view datasets. Recent years
have witnessed rapid progress driven by the availability of large-scale
datasets and novel approaches. Typically, cross-view localization is formulated
as an image retrieval problem where ground-level features are matched with
tiled overhead images feature, extracted by convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) or vision transformers (ViTs) for cross-view feature embedding.
Cross-view synthesis, on the other hand, seeks to generate ground-level views
based on information from overhead imagery, generally using generative
adversarial networks (GANs) or diffusion models. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey of advances in cross-view localization and synthesis,
reviewing widely used datasets, highlighting key challenges, and providing an
organized overview of state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, it discusses
current limitations, offers comparative analyses, and outlines promising
directions for future research. We also include the project page via

Motivation: 由于公开数据集稀缺且多变，糖尿病足溃疡检测具有临床意义但颇具挑战性。

Method: 设计了混合架构ConMatFormer，结合局部特征提取和全局上下文理解，通过数据增强解决类别不平衡问题，并使用Transformer模块增强长距离依赖。

Conclusion: ConMatFormer为DFU分类设定了新基准，并为医学图像分析提供了混合注意力Transformer框架。

Abstract: Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) detection is a clinically significant yet
challenging task due to the scarcity and variability of publicly available
datasets. To solve these problems, we propose ConMatFormer, a new hybrid deep
learning architecture that combines ConvNeXt blocks, multiple attention
mechanisms convolutional block attention module (CBAM) and dual attention
network (DANet), and transformer modules in a way that works together. This
design facilitates the extraction of better local features and understanding of
the global context, which allows us to model small skin patterns across
different types of DFU very accurately. To address the class imbalance, we used
data augmentation methods. A ConvNeXt block was used to obtain detailed local
features in the initial stages. Subsequently, we compiled the model by adding a
transformer module to enhance long-range dependency. This enabled us to
pinpoint the DFU classes that were underrepresented or constituted minorities.
Tests on the DS1 (DFUC2021) and DS2 (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)) datasets showed
that ConMatFormer outperformed state-of-the-art (SOTA) convolutional neural
network (CNN) and Vision Transformer (ViT) models in terms of accuracy,
reliability, and flexibility. The proposed method achieved an accuracy of
0.8961 and a precision of 0.9160 in a single experiment, which is a significant
improvement over the current standards for classifying DFUs. In addition, by
4-fold cross-validation, the proposed model achieved an accuracy of 0.9755 with
a standard deviation of only 0.0031. We further applied explainable artificial
intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Grad-CAM, Grad-CAM++, and LIME, to
consistently monitor the transparency and trustworthiness of the
decision-making process.. Our findings set a new benchmark for DFU
classification and provide a hybrid attention transformer framework for medical
image analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为自校准一致性（SCC）的测试时防御方法，通过语义一致性和空间一致性模块提升CLIP模型在零样本设置下的对抗鲁棒性，同时保持准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练的视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在零样本场景中表现出强大能力，但对对抗性扰动非常脆弱。现有防御方法依赖带标签数据的对抗性微调，限制了其在零样本中的适用性。

Method: 提出了自校准一致性（SCC），包括语义一致性（利用软伪标签和多视角预测）和空间一致性（通过增强视图对齐视觉预测）。

Result: 在22个基准测试中，SCC显著提升了CLIP的对抗鲁棒性，且不影响准确性，还能与其他视觉语言模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: SCC为CLIP及其他视觉语言模型提供了有效的对抗鲁棒性解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP have demonstrated
strong zero-shot capabilities across diverse domains, yet remain highly
vulnerable to adversarial perturbations that disrupt image-text alignment and
compromise reliability. Existing defenses typically rely on adversarial
fine-tuning with labeled data, limiting their applicability in zero-shot
settings. In this work, we identify two key weaknesses of current CLIP
adversarial attacks -- lack of semantic guidance and vulnerability to view
variations -- collectively termed semantic and viewpoint fragility. To address
these challenges, we propose Self-Calibrated Consistency (SCC), an effective
test-time defense. SCC consists of two complementary modules: Semantic
consistency, which leverages soft pseudo-labels from counterattack warm-up and
multi-view predictions to regularize cross-modal alignment and separate the
target embedding from confusable negatives; and Spatial consistency, aligning
perturbed visual predictions via augmented views to stabilize inference under
adversarial perturbations. Together, these modules form a plug-and-play
inference strategy. Extensive experiments on 22 benchmarks under diverse attack
settings show that SCC consistently improves the zero-shot robustness of CLIP
while maintaining accuracy, and can be seamlessly integrated with other VLMs
for further gains. These findings highlight the great potential of establishing
an adversarially robust paradigm from CLIP, with implications extending to
broader vision-language domains such as BioMedCLIP.

Result: 当前开源文本到图像模型在新基准上表现较差，但Revise-Then-Enforce方法显著提升了图像文本对齐效果。

Conclusion: 新基准和方法为文本到图像生成中的对齐问题提供了有效的评估和改进途径。

Abstract: Text-to-image models are known to struggle with generating images that
perfectly align with textual prompts. Several previous studies have focused on
evaluating image-text alignment in text-to-image generation. However, these
evaluations either address overly simple scenarios, especially overlooking the
difficulty of prompts with multiple different instances belonging to the same
category, or they introduce metrics that do not correlate well with human
evaluation. In this study, we introduce M$^3$T2IBench, a large-scale,
multi-category, multi-instance, multi-relation along with an
object-detection-based evaluation metric, $AlignScore$, which aligns closely
with human evaluation. Our findings reveal that current open-source
text-to-image models perform poorly on this challenging benchmark.
Additionally, we propose the Revise-Then-Enforce approach to enhance image-text
alignment. This training-free post-editing method demonstrates improvements in
image-text alignment across a broad range of diffusion models. \footnote{Our
code and data has been released in supplementary material and will be made

Conclusion: UniAIDet为未来研究提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of image generative models, the authenticity of
digital images has become a significant concern. While existing studies have
proposed various methods for detecting AI-generated content, current benchmarks
are limited in their coverage of diverse generative models and image
categories, often overlooking end-to-end image editing and artistic images. To
address these limitations, we introduce UniAIDet, a unified and comprehensive
benchmark that includes both photographic and artistic images. UniAIDet covers
a wide range of generative models, including text-to-image, image-to-image,
image inpainting, image editing, and deepfake models. Using UniAIDet, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various detection methods and answer
three key research questions regarding generalization capability and the
relation between detection and localization. Our benchmark and analysis provide
a robust foundation for future research.

*Fatemeh Nazarieh,Zhenhua Feng,Diptesh Kanojia,Muhammad Awais,Josef Kittler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAGIC-Talk是一种基于扩散模型的单次拍摄框架，用于生成可定制且时间稳定的说话人脸，解决了现有方法在时间一致性、身份保持和长视频生成中的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动的说话人脸生成在数字媒体和虚拟形象中应用广泛，但现有方法在时间一致性、身份保持和长视频生成中表现不佳。

Method: MAGIC-Talk包含ReferenceNet（通过文本提示保持身份并实现细粒度编辑）和AnimateNet（利用结构化运动先验增强运动一致性），并结合渐进式潜在融合策略提高长视频质量。

Result: 实验表明，MAGIC-Talk在视觉质量、身份保持和同步准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAGIC-Talk为说话人脸生成提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking face generation has gained significant attention for
applications in digital media and virtual avatars. While recent methods improve
audio-lip synchronization, they often struggle with temporal consistency,
identity preservation, and customization, especially in long video generation.
To address these issues, we propose MAGIC-Talk, a one-shot diffusion-based
framework for customizable and temporally stable talking face generation.
MAGIC-Talk consists of ReferenceNet, which preserves identity and enables
fine-grained facial editing via text prompts, and AnimateNet, which enhances
motion coherence using structured motion priors. Unlike previous methods
requiring multiple reference images or fine-tuning, MAGIC-Talk maintains
identity from a single image while ensuring smooth transitions across frames.
Additionally, a progressive latent fusion strategy is introduced to improve
long-form video quality by reducing motion inconsistencies and flickering.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MAGIC-Talk outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in visual quality, identity preservation, and synchronization accuracy,
offering a robust solution for talking face generation.

Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) systems lack simple, reproducible ways to evaluate how
well images match prompts and how models treat social attributes. Common
proxies -- face classifiers and contrastive similarity -- reward surface cues,
lack calibrated abstention, and miss attributes only weakly visible (for
example, religion, culture, disability). We present FairJudge, a lightweight
protocol that treats instruction-following multimodal LLMs as fair judges. It
scores alignment with an explanation-oriented rubric mapped to [-1, 1];
constrains judgments to a closed label set; requires evidence grounded in the
visible content; and mandates abstention when cues are insufficient. Unlike
CLIP-only pipelines, FairJudge yields accountable, evidence-aware decisions;
unlike mitigation that alters generators, it targets evaluation fairness. We
evaluate gender, race, and age on FairFace, PaTA, and FairCoT; extend to
religion, culture, and disability; and assess profession correctness and
alignment on IdenProf, FairCoT-Professions, and our new DIVERSIFY-Professions.
We also release DIVERSIFY, a 469-image corpus of diverse, non-iconic scenes.
Across datasets, judge models outperform contrastive and face-centric baselines
on demographic prediction and improve mean alignment while maintaining high
profession accuracy, enabling more reliable, reproducible fairness audits.

Motivation: 研究商业广告的记忆性预测，作为MediaEval 2025研讨会竞赛的一部分，旨在探索多模态融合系统在提升记忆性预测性能方面的潜力。

Method: 提出了一种基于Gemma-3 LLM的多模态融合系统，整合了预计算的视觉（ViT）和文本（E5）特征，并通过多模态投影实现融合。模型采用LoRA进行适配，并以梯度提升树的集成作为基线。

Conclusion: LLM生成的理由提示和多模态融合方法的结合有效提升了商业广告记忆性预测的性能，展现了其在类似任务中的潜力。

Abstract: This paper addresses the prediction of commercial (brand) memorability as
part of "Subtask 2: Commercial/Ad Memorability" within the "Memorability:
Predicting movie and commercial memorability" task at the MediaEval 2025
workshop competition. We propose a multimodal fusion system with a Gemma-3 LLM
backbone that integrates pre-computed visual (ViT) and textual (E5) features by
multi-modal projections. The model is adapted using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
A heavily-tuned ensemble of gradient boosted trees serves as a baseline. A key
contribution is the use of LLM-generated rationale prompts, grounded in
expert-derived aspects of memorability, to guide the fusion model. The results
demonstrate that the LLM-based system exhibits greater robustness and
generalization performance on the final test set, compared to the baseline.

Result: 在多风格数据集上的实验表明，SP-CSVR在视觉描述、视觉问答和上下文风格适应中表现最佳。

Conclusion: SP-CSVR通过提升跨风格语义理解的鲁棒性和泛化能力，有效解决了‘风格陷阱’问题。

Abstract: The "style trap" poses a significant challenge for Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs), hindering robust semantic understanding across diverse visual
styles, especially in in-context learning (ICL). Existing methods often fail to
effectively decouple style from content, hindering generalization. To address
this, we propose the Semantic-Preserving Cross-Style Visual Reasoner (SP-CSVR),
a novel framework for stable semantic understanding and adaptive cross-style
visual reasoning. SP-CSVR integrates a Cross-Style Feature Encoder (CSFE) for
style-content disentanglement, a Semantic-Aligned In-Context Decoder (SAICD)
for efficient few-shot style adaptation, and an Adaptive Semantic Consistency
Module (ASCM) employing multi-task contrastive learning to enforce cross-style
semantic invariance. Extensive experiments on a challenging multi-style dataset
demonstrate SP-CSVR's state-of-the-art performance across visual captioning,
visual question answering, and in-context style adaptation. Comprehensive
evaluations, including ablation studies and generalization analysis, confirm
SP-CSVR's efficacy in enhancing robustness, generalization, and efficiency
across diverse visual styles.

Result: 在对象、显式内容、艺术风格和多名人擦除任务中表现优异，保持图像质量和局部性。

Conclusion: Semantic Surgery为更安全的文本到图像生成提供了高效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Concept erasure in text-to-image diffusion models is crucial for mitigating
harmful content, yet existing methods often compromise generative quality. We
introduce Semantic Surgery, a novel training-free, zero-shot framework for
concept erasure that operates directly on text embeddings before the diffusion
process. It dynamically estimates the presence of target concepts in a prompt
and performs a calibrated vector subtraction to neutralize their influence at
the source, enhancing both erasure completeness and locality. The framework
includes a Co-Occurrence Encoding module for robust multi-concept erasure and a
visual feedback loop to address latent concept persistence. As a training-free
method, Semantic Surgery adapts dynamically to each prompt, ensuring precise
interventions. Extensive experiments on object, explicit content, artistic
style, and multi-celebrity erasure tasks show our method significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve superior completeness and
robustness while preserving locality and image quality (e.g., 93.58 H-score in
object erasure, reducing explicit content to just 1 instance, and 8.09 H_a in
style erasure with no quality degradation). This robustness also allows our
framework to function as a built-in threat detection system, offering a
practical solution for safer text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Wind turbine blades operate in harsh environments, making timely damage
detection essential for preventing failures and optimizing maintenance.
Drone-based inspection and deep learning are promising, but typically depend on
large, labeled datasets, which limit their ability to detect rare or evolving
damage types. To address this, we propose a zero-shot-oriented inspection
framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with
Vision-Language Models (VLM). A multimodal knowledge base is constructed,
comprising technical documentation, representative reference images, and
domain-specific guidelines. A hybrid text-image retriever with keyword-aware
reranking assembles the most relevant context to condition the VLM at
inference, injecting domain knowledge without task-specific training. We
evaluate the framework on 30 labeled blade images covering diverse damage
categories. Although the dataset is small due to the difficulty of acquiring
verified blade imagery, it covers multiple representative defect types. On this
test set, the RAG-grounded VLM correctly classified all samples, whereas the
same VLM without retrieval performed worse in both accuracy and precision. We
further compare against open-vocabulary baselines and incorporate uncertainty
Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals to account for the small-sample setting.
Ablation studies indicate that the key advantage of the framework lies in
explainability and generalizability: retrieved references ground the reasoning
process and enable the detection of previously unseen defects by leveraging
domain knowledge rather than relying solely on visual cues. This research
contributes a data-efficient solution for industrial inspection that reduces
dependence on extensive labeled datasets.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of pasture biomass is important for decision-making in

manage stocking rates to maximise pasture utilisation, while minimising the
risk of overgrazing and promoting overall system health. We present a
comprehensive dataset of 1,162 annotated top-view images of pastures collected
across 19 locations in Australia. The images were taken across multiple seasons
and include a range of temperate pasture species. Each image captures a 70cm *
30cm quadrat and is paired with on-ground measurements including biomass sorted
by component (green, dead, and legume fraction), vegetation height, and
Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Active Optical Sensors
(AOS). The multidimensional nature of the data, which combines visual,
spectral, and structural information, opens up new possibilities for advancing
the use of precision grazing management. The dataset is released and hosted in

Motivation: 解决LangSplat因每场景训练语言自编码器导致的效率瓶颈，以实现更高效、可扩展的开放词汇3D语言场建模。

Result: Gen-LangSplat在保持或超越LangSplat查询性能的同时，显著提升构建效率。

Conclusion: 通用嵌入方法为实时交互3D AI应用提供了高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Modeling open-vocabulary language fields in 3D is essential for intuitive
human-AI interaction and querying within physical environments.
State-of-the-art approaches, such as LangSplat, leverage 3D Gaussian Splatting
to efficiently construct these language fields, encoding features distilled
from high-dimensional models like CLIP. However, this efficiency is currently
offset by the requirement to train a scene-specific language autoencoder for
feature compression, introducing a costly, per-scene optimization bottleneck
that hinders deployment scalability. In this work, we introduce Gen-LangSplat,
that eliminates this requirement by replacing the scene-wise autoencoder with a
generalized autoencoder, pre-trained extensively on the large-scale ScanNet
dataset. This architectural shift enables the use of a fixed, compact latent
space for language features across any new scene without any scene-specific
training. By removing this dependency, our entire language field construction
process achieves a efficiency boost while delivering querying performance
comparable to, or exceeding, the original LangSplat method. To validate our
design choice, we perform a thorough ablation study empirically determining the
optimal latent embedding dimension and quantifying representational fidelity
using Mean Squared Error and cosine similarity between the original and
reprojected 512-dimensional CLIP embeddings. Our results demonstrate that
generalized embeddings can efficiently and accurately support open-vocabulary
querying in novel 3D scenes, paving the way for scalable, real-time interactive
3D AI applications.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种称为位置保持嵌入（PPE）的新编码方法，旨在在视觉令牌压缩过程中保持时空结构，解决了现有方法忽略位置关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但冗余的视觉令牌导致了低效率。现有令牌合并方法减少了序列长度，但常因忽略位置关系而破坏空间布局和时间连续性。

Method: PPE通过在令牌维度明确引入3D位置的解耦编码，使每个压缩令牌能够封装来自多个原始令牌的不同位置，同时支持级联聚类策略。

Result: PPE在多个视觉语言基准测试中（如MMBench、TextVQA和VideoMME）实现了2%至5%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 保持位置信息对高效且有效的MLLM推理至关重要。PPE作为一种参数无关的通用操作符，可无缝集成到现有令牌合并方法中。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, yet often suffer from inefficiencies due to redundant
visual tokens. Existing token merging methods reduce sequence length but
frequently disrupt spatial layouts and temporal continuity by disregarding
positional relationships. In this work, we propose a novel encoding operator
dubbed as \textbf{P}ositional \textbf{P}reservation \textbf{E}mbedding
(\textbf{PPE}), which has the main hallmark of preservation of spatiotemporal
structure during visual token compression. PPE explicitly introduces the
disentangled encoding of 3D positions in the token dimension, enabling each
compressed token to encapsulate different positions from multiple original
tokens. Furthermore, we show that PPE can effectively support cascade
clustering -- a progressive token compression strategy that leads to better
performance retention. PPE is a parameter-free and generic operator that can be
seamlessly integrated into existing token merging methods without any
adjustments. Applied to state-of-the-art token merging framework, PPE achieves
consistent improvements of $2\%\sim5\%$ across multiple vision-language
benchmarks, including MMBench (general vision understanding), TextVQA (layout
understanding) and VideoMME (temporal understanding). These results demonstrate
that preserving positional cues is critical for efficient and effective MLLM
reasoning.

Motivation: 传统全局码本策略在处理富含属性的面部图像时忽视了图像内部的类别相关性和标记间的语义差异，导致在低比特率下性能不佳。

Method: 提出一种学习不同图像类别的独立码本组的方法，并为每个标记分配一个独立的码本，通过记录标记所属码本组来减少损失。

Result: 该方法在0.05 bpp下对重建图像的平均准确率达到93.51%。

Conclusion: 这种方法可以集成到任何现有的基于码本的表征学习方法中，显著提升了面部图像压缩的性能。

Abstract: With the ever-increasing volume of visual data, the efficient and lossless
transmission, along with its subsequent interpretation and understanding, has
become a critical bottleneck in modern information systems. The emerged
codebook-based solution utilize a globally shared codebook to quantize and
dequantize each token, controlling the bpp by adjusting the number of tokens or
the codebook size. However, for facial images, which are rich in attributes,
such global codebook strategies overlook both the category-specific
correlations within images and the semantic differences among tokens, resulting
in suboptimal performance, especially at low bpp. Motivated by these
observations, we propose a Switchable Token-Specific Codebook Quantization for
face image compression, which learns distinct codebook groups for different
image categories and assigns an independent codebook to each token. By
recording the codebook group to which each token belongs with a small number of
bits, our method can reduce the loss incurred when decreasing the size of each
codebook group. This enables a larger total number of codebooks under a lower
overall bpp, thereby enhancing the expressive capability and improving
reconstruction performance. Owing to its generalizable design, our method can
be integrated into any existing codebook-based representation learning approach
and has demonstrated its effectiveness on face recognition datasets, achieving
an average accuracy of 93.51% for reconstructed images at 0.05 bpp.

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，如GenEval得分0.91，DPG-Bench得分82.16等。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且性能优越，为未来多模态建模研究提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Unified multimodal models have recently shown remarkable gains in both
capability and versatility, yet most leading systems are still trained from
scratch and require substantial computational resources. In this paper, we show
that competitive performance can be obtained far more efficiently by
strategically fusing publicly available models specialized for either
generation or understanding. Our key design is to retain the original blocks
while additionally interleaving multimodal self-attention blocks throughout the
networks. This double fusion mechanism (1) effectively enables rich multi-modal
fusion while largely preserving the original strengths of the base models, and
(2) catalyzes synergistic fusion of high-level semantic representations from
the understanding encoder with low-level spatial signals from the generation
encoder. By training with only ~ 35B tokens, this approach achieves strong
results across multiple benchmarks: 0.91 on GenEval for compositional
text-to-image generation, 82.16 on DPG-Bench for complex text-to-image
generation, 6.06 on GEditBench, and 3.77 on ImgEdit-Bench for image editing. By
fully releasing the entire suite of code, model weights, and datasets, we hope
to support future research on unified multimodal modeling.

Motivation: 现有的无训练视频编辑模型在处理职业相关提示时容易陷入性别刻板印象，因此需要一种能够减少性别偏见并保持视频连贯性的方法。

Method: FAME 通过软注入去偏见令牌生成公平嵌入，并在时间和交叉注意力中引入公平调制机制，包括区域受限的注意力掩码和时间衰减权重，以减少运动破坏和时间不一致性。

Result: 在 FairVE 基准测试中，FAME 表现出更强的公平对齐和语义保真度，优于现有视频编辑基线方法。

Conclusion: FAME 通过公平嵌入和注意力调制，有效减少了视频编辑中的性别偏见，同时保持了高质量的视频连贯性和语义一致性。

Abstract: Training-free video editing (VE) models tend to fall back on gender
stereotypes when rendering profession-related prompts. We propose \textbf{FAME}
for \textit{Fairness-aware Attention-modulated Video Editing} that mitigates
profession-related gender biases while preserving prompt alignment and temporal
consistency for coherent VE. We derive fairness embeddings from existing
minority representations by softly injecting debiasing tokens into the text
encoder. Simultaneously, FAME integrates fairness modulation into both temporal
self attention and prompt-to-region cross attention to mitigate the motion
corruption and temporal inconsistency caused by directly introducing fairness
cues. For temporal self attention, FAME introduces a region constrained
attention mask combined with time decay weighting, which enhances intra-region
coherence while suppressing irrelevant inter-region interactions. For cross
attention, it reweights tokens to region matching scores by incorporating
fairness sensitive similarity masks derived from debiasing prompt embeddings.
Together, these modulations keep fairness-sensitive semantics tied to the right
visual regions and prevent temporal drift across frames. Extensive experiments
on new VE fairness-oriented benchmark \textit{FairVE} demonstrate that FAME
achieves stronger fairness alignment and semantic fidelity, surpassing existing
VE baselines.

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed natural language processing and computer
vision, and their impact is now reshaping remote sensing image analysis. With
powerful generalization and transfer learning capabilities, they align
naturally with the multimodal, multi-resolution, and multi-temporal
characteristics of remote sensing data. To address unique challenges in the
field, multimodal geospatial foundation models (GFMs) have emerged as a
dedicated research frontier. This survey delivers a comprehensive review of
multimodal GFMs from a modality-driven perspective, covering five core visual
and vision-language modalities. We examine how differences in imaging physics
and data representation shape interaction design, and we analyze key techniques
for alignment, integration, and knowledge transfer to tackle modality
heterogeneity, distribution shifts, and semantic gaps. Advances in training
paradigms, architectures, and task-specific adaptation strategies are
systematically assessed alongside a wealth of emerging benchmarks.
Representative multimodal visual and vision-language GFMs are evaluated across
ten downstream tasks, with insights into their architectures, performance, and
application scenarios. Real-world case studies, spanning land cover mapping,
agricultural monitoring, disaster response, climate studies, and geospatial
intelligence, demonstrate the practical potential of GFMs. Finally, we outline
pressing challenges in domain generalization, interpretability, efficiency, and
privacy, and chart promising avenues for future research.

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free video editing have enabled lightweight and
precise cross-frame generation by leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models. However, existing methods often rely on heuristic frame
selection to maintain temporal consistency during DDIM inversion, which
introduces manual bias and reduces the scalability of end-to-end inference. In
this paper, we propose~\textbf{VALA} (\textbf{V}ariational \textbf{A}lignment
for \textbf{L}atent \textbf{A}nchors), a variational alignment module that
adaptively selects key frames and compresses their latent features into
semantic anchors for consistent video editing. To learn meaningful assignments,
VALA propose a variational framework with a contrastive learning objective.
Therefore, it can transform cross-frame latent representations into compressed
latent anchors that preserve both content and temporal coherence. Our method
can be fully integrated into training-free text-to-image based video editing
models. Extensive experiments on real-world video editing benchmarks show that
VALA achieves state-of-the-art performance in inversion fidelity, editing
quality, and temporal consistency, while offering improved efficiency over
prior methods.

Occupancy-centric methods have recently achieved state-of-the-art results by
offering consistent conditioning across frames and modalities; however, their
performance heavily depends on annotated occupancy data, which still remains
scarce. To overcome this limitation, we curate Nuplan-Occ, the largest semantic
occupancy dataset to date, constructed from the widely used Nuplan benchmark.
Its scale and diversity facilitate not only large-scale generative modeling but
also autonomous driving downstream applications. Based on this dataset, we
develop a unified framework that jointly synthesizes high-quality semantic
occupancy, multi-view videos, and LiDAR point clouds. Our approach incorporates
a spatio-temporal disentangled architecture to support high-fidelity spatial
expansion and temporal forecasting of 4D dynamic occupancy. To bridge modal
gaps, we further propose two novel techniques: a Gaussian splatting-based
sparse point map rendering strategy that enhances multi-view video generation,
and a sensor-aware embedding strategy that explicitly models LiDAR sensor
properties for realistic multi-LiDAR simulation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves superior generation fidelity and
scalability compared to existing approaches, and validates its practical value
in downstream tasks. Repo:

TL;DR: VoMP是一种前馈方法，用于预测3D物体体积内的材料属性（E、ν、ρ），并通过多视图特征聚合和几何变换器实现高效、准确的预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统物理模拟中材料属性的获取依赖手工制作，耗时且低效。VoMP旨在自动化这一过程，并通过学习真实数据集保证材料属性的物理合理性。

Method: VoMP通过多视图特征聚合和几何变换器预测每个体素的材料潜在编码，并使用真实世界数据集学习材料流形。训练数据通过结合3D分割数据集、材料数据库和视觉语言模型的标注流程生成。

Result: 实验表明，VoMP在预测体积材料属性方面优于现有方法，且在准确性和速度上表现优异。

Conclusion: VoMP提供了一种高效且准确的自动化方法，用于预测3D物体的材料属性，解决了传统手工方法的不足。

Abstract: Physical simulation relies on spatially-varying mechanical properties, often
laboriously hand-crafted. VoMP is a feed-forward method trained to predict
Young's modulus ($E$), Poisson's ratio ($\nu$), and density ($\rho$) throughout
the volume of 3D objects, in any representation that can be rendered and
voxelized. VoMP aggregates per-voxel multi-view features and passes them to our
trained Geometry Transformer to predict per-voxel material latent codes. These
latents reside on a manifold of physically plausible materials, which we learn
from a real-world dataset, guaranteeing the validity of decoded per-voxel
materials. To obtain object-level training data, we propose an annotation
pipeline combining knowledge from segmented 3D datasets, material databases,
and a vision-language model, along with a new benchmark. Experiments show that
VoMP estimates accurate volumetric properties, far outperforming prior art in
accuracy and speed.

TL;DR: SceneDecorator框架解决了文本到图像生成中的场景一致性和叙事连贯性问题，通过无训练的方法提升了多故事场景的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在角色一致性上表现较好，但忽视了场景在叙事中的重要性，限制了创造力。

Method: 提出SceneDecorator框架，结合VLM-Guided Scene Planning和Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention，以无训练方式确保场景一致性和叙事连贯性。

Result: 实验表明SceneDecorator优于现有方法，展示了在艺术、电影和游戏领域的广泛应用潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为多故事场景一致性提供了一种高效解决方案，推动了文本到图像生成的创新发展。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image models have revolutionized image generation, but they
still struggle with maintaining concept consistency across generated images.
While existing works focus on character consistency, they often overlook the
crucial role of scenes in storytelling, which restricts their creativity in
practice. This paper introduces scene-oriented story generation, addressing two
key challenges: (i) scene planning, where current methods fail to ensure
scene-level narrative coherence by relying solely on text descriptions, and
(ii) scene consistency, which remains largely unexplored in terms of
maintaining scene consistency across multiple stories. We propose
SceneDecorator, a training-free framework that employs VLM-Guided Scene
Planning to ensure narrative coherence across different scenes in a
``global-to-local'' manner, and Long-Term Scene-Sharing Attention to maintain
long-term scene consistency and subject diversity across generated stories.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of SceneDecorator,
highlighting its potential to unleash creativity in the fields of arts, films,
and games.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CoMo框架，用于文本到视频生成中的复合运动定制，解决了多主题运动的精确控制和运动-外观解耦问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频模型在复杂多主题运动控制上表现不佳，尤其是运动定制时存在运动-外观纠缠和多运动融合不足的问题。

Method: CoMo采用两阶段方法：单运动学习阶段通过静态-动态解耦调优分离运动与外观；多运动合成阶段通过分治合并策略组合运动模块。

Result: 实验表明CoMo在多运动保真度和融合效果上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: CoMo显著提升了可控视频生成能力，并提供了一个新的评估基准。

Abstract: While recent text-to-video models excel at generating diverse scenes, they
struggle with precise motion control, particularly for complex, multi-subject
motions. Although methods for single-motion customization have been developed
to address this gap, they fail in compositional scenarios due to two primary
challenges: motion-appearance entanglement and ineffective multi-motion
blending. This paper introduces CoMo, a novel framework for
$\textbf{compositional motion customization}$ in text-to-video generation,
enabling the synthesis of multiple, distinct motions within a single video.
CoMo addresses these issues through a two-phase approach. First, in the
single-motion learning phase, a static-dynamic decoupled tuning paradigm
disentangles motion from appearance to learn a motion-specific module. Second,
in the multi-motion composition phase, a plug-and-play divide-and-merge
strategy composes these learned motions without additional training by
spatially isolating their influence during the denoising process. To facilitate
research in this new domain, we also introduce a new benchmark and a novel
evaluation metric designed to assess multi-motion fidelity and blending.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoMo achieves state-of-the-art
performance, significantly advancing the capabilities of controllable video
generation. Our project page is at https://como6.github.io/.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自回归模型在图像生成中计算复杂度高且样本多样性有限，NestAR致力于解决这些问题。

Method: 提出嵌套自回归架构和多尺度模块，结合流匹配损失和训练目标协调。

Result: 显著降低计算成本并提升性能，复杂度从O(n)降至O(log n)。

Conclusion: NestAR在保持竞争力的同时，提升了效率和多样性。

Abstract: AutoRegressive (AR) models have demonstrated competitive performance in image
generation, achieving results comparable to those of diffusion models. However,
their token-by-token image generation mechanism remains computationally
intensive and existing solutions such as VAR often lead to limited sample
diversity. In this work, we propose a Nested AutoRegressive~(NestAR) model,
which proposes nested AutoRegressive architectures in generating images. NestAR
designs multi-scale modules in a hierarchical order. These different scaled
modules are constructed in an AR architecture, where one larger-scale module is
conditioned on outputs from its previous smaller-scale module. Within each
module, NestAR uses another AR structure to generate ``patches'' of tokens. The
proposed nested AR architecture reduces the overall complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n)$ in generating $n$ image tokens, as
well as increases image diversities. NestAR further incorporates flow matching
loss to use continuous tokens, and develops objectives to coordinate these
multi-scale modules in model training. NestAR achieves competitive image
generation performance while significantly lowering computational cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法在长视频中常因过度下采样或固定窗口而损失时序保真度，需要一种既能捕获全局上下文又能保持细粒度时间细节的方法。

Method: 提出HieraMamba架构，核心是AMP块，利用Mamba的选择性扫描生成多粒度锚点令牌；结合锚点条件和片段池化对比损失。

Result: 在Ego4D-NLQ、MAD和TACoS数据集上实现了新的最优性能，展现了长未修剪视频中的精确时序定位。

Conclusion: HieraMamba通过分层结构和对比损失，有效平衡了全局和局部信息，显著提升了时序定位的准确性。

Abstract: Video temporal grounding, the task of localizing the start and end times of a
natural language query in untrimmed video, requires capturing both global
context and fine-grained temporal detail. This challenge is particularly
pronounced in long videos, where existing methods often compromise temporal
fidelity by over-downsampling or relying on fixed windows. We present
HieraMamba, a hierarchical architecture that preserves temporal structure and
semantic richness across scales. At its core are Anchor-MambaPooling (AMP)
blocks, which utilize Mamba's selective scanning to produce compact anchor
tokens that summarize video content at multiple granularities. Two
complementary objectives, anchor-conditioned and segment-pooled contrastive
losses, encourage anchors to retain local detail while remaining globally
discriminative. HieraMamba sets a new state-of-the-art on Ego4D-NLQ, MAD, and
TACoS, demonstrating precise, temporally faithful localization in long,
untrimmed videos.

TL;DR: EndoWave提出了一种统一时空高斯泼溅框架，通过结合光流几何约束和多分辨率小波监督，解决了内窥镜视频中3D重建的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜手术场景中存在光度不一致、非刚性组织运动和视角依赖高光等问题，传统基于3DGS的方法难以准确重建。

Method: 提出统一的时空高斯表示，引入光流几何约束和多分辨率有理小波监督，直接在4D域优化基元。

Result: 在两个真实手术数据集上的实验表明，EndoWave在重建质量和视觉准确度上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: EndoWave通过创新的时空约束方法，显著提升了内窥镜场景下的3D重建效果。

Abstract: In robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery, accurate 3D reconstruction from
endoscopic video is vital for downstream tasks and improved outcomes. However,
endoscopic scenarios present unique challenges, including photometric
inconsistencies, non-rigid tissue motion, and view-dependent highlights. Most
3DGS-based methods that rely solely on appearance constraints for optimizing
3DGS are often insufficient in this context, as these dynamic visual artifacts
can mislead the optimization process and lead to inaccurate reconstructions. To
address these limitations, we present EndoWave, a unified spatio-temporal
Gaussian Splatting framework by incorporating an optical flow-based geometric
constraint and a multi-resolution rational wavelet supervision. First, we adopt
a unified spatio-temporal Gaussian representation that directly optimizes
primitives in a 4D domain. Second, we propose a geometric constraint derived
from optical flow to enhance temporal coherence and effectively constrain the
3D structure of the scene. Third, we propose a multi-resolution rational
orthogonal wavelet as a constraint, which can effectively separate the details
of the endoscope and enhance the rendering performance. Extensive evaluations
on two real surgical datasets, EndoNeRF and StereoMIS, demonstrate that our
method EndoWave achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and visual
accuracy compared to the baseline method.

Motivation: 多模态位置编码在视觉语言模型中至关重要，但缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 提出Multi-Head RoPE（MHRoPE）和MRoPE-Interleave（MRoPE-I）两种改进方法，无需架构更改。

Result: 方法在多样化基准测试中显著优于现有方法，提升多模态理解能力。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效改进多模态位置编码，表现优越且易于实现。

Abstract: Multimodal position encoding is essential for vision-language models, yet
there has been little systematic investigation into multimodal position
encoding. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of multimodal Rotary Positional
Embedding (RoPE) by examining its two core components: position design and
frequency allocation. Through extensive experiments, we identify three key
guidelines: positional coherence, full frequency utilization, and preservation
of textual priors-ensuring unambiguous layout, rich representation, and
faithful transfer from the pre-trained LLM. Based on these insights, we propose
Multi-Head RoPE (MHRoPE) and MRoPE-Interleave (MRoPE-I), two simple and
plug-and-play variants that require no architectural changes. Our methods
consistently outperform existing approaches across diverse benchmarks, with
significant improvements in both general and fine-grained multimodal
understanding. Code will be avaliable at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散桥模型缺乏统一的分析视角，且通过全局噪声注入和移除重构图像时容易破坏未退化区域，因此需要一种更优的方法。

Method: 提出RDBM，理论推导广义扩散桥的随机微分方程，并通过残差调制噪声注入和移除，实现区域自适应恢复。

Result: 实验证明RDBM在各种图像恢复任务中表现最优，且现有桥模型均为RDBM的特例。

Conclusion: RDBM为扩散桥模型提供了统一视角，并在图像恢复中实现了自适应和最优性能。

Abstract: Diffusion bridge models establish probabilistic paths between arbitrary
paired distributions and exhibit great potential for universal image
restoration. Most existing methods merely treat them as simple variants of
stochastic interpolants, lacking a unified analytical perspective. Besides,
they indiscriminately reconstruct images through global noise injection and
removal, inevitably distorting undegraded regions due to imperfect
reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose the Residual Diffusion
Bridge Model (RDBM). Specifically, we theoretically reformulate the stochastic
differential equations of generalized diffusion bridge and derive the
analytical formulas of its forward and reverse processes. Crucially, we
leverage the residuals from given distributions to modulate the noise injection
and removal, enabling adaptive restoration of degraded regions while preserving
intact others. Moreover, we unravel the fundamental mathematical essence of
existing bridge models, all of which are special cases of RDBM and empirically
demonstrate the optimality of our proposed models. Extensive experiments are
conducted to demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method both
qualitatively and quantitatively across diverse image restoration tasks. Code

Method: 采用确定性及学习策略对时间序列量化，并通过掩码相关性学习目标，将离散的图像和时间序列标记对齐到统一表示空间中。

Result: 在地球观测领域的实验中，预训练模型从卫星图像生成一致的全球温度剖面，下游任务中表现优于任务特定融合方法（R²提高6%，RMSE提升2%），并显著超越基线方法（R²提高50%，RMSE提升12%）。

Conclusion: 该框架在多模态融合中表现出色，并通过梯度敏感性分析揭示了模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: We propose a task-agnostic framework for multimodal fusion of time series and
single timestamp images, enabling cross-modal generation and robust downstream
performance. Our approach explores deterministic and learned strategies for
time series quantization and then leverages a masked correlation learning
objective, aligning discrete image and time series tokens in a unified
representation space. Instantiated in the Earth observation domain, the
pretrained model generates consistent global temperature profiles from
satellite imagery and is validated through counterfactual experiments. Across
downstream tasks, our task-agnostic pretraining outperforms task-specific
fusion by 6\% in R$^2$ and 2\% in RMSE on average, and exceeds baseline methods
by 50\% in R$^2$ and 12\% in RMSE. Finally, we analyze gradient sensitivity
across modalities, providing insights into model robustness. Code, data, and
weights will be released under a permissive license.

Motivation: 土壤盐碱化对生态系统和农业造成威胁，传统方法难以兼顾精准性和大范围监测，因此需要结合实验室光谱和卫星遥感优势。

Method: 采用深度学习框架DeepSalt，利用知识蒸馏和频谱适应单元，将实验室高分辨率光谱信息迁移到卫星遥感数据中。

Result: DeepSalt在未明显域适应的方法上取得显著性能提升，并能推广到未见地理区域，解释了大量盐分变异。

Conclusion: DeepSalt有效解决了实验室与卫星遥感数据的鸿沟，为大范围土壤盐分监测提供了精准且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Soil salinization poses a significant threat to both ecosystems and
agriculture because it limits plants' ability to absorb water and, in doing so,
reduces crop productivity. This phenomenon alters the soil's spectral
properties, creating a measurable relationship between salinity and light
reflectance that enables remote monitoring. While laboratory spectroscopy
provides precise measurements, its reliance on in-situ sampling limits
scalability to regional or global levels. Conversely, hyperspectral satellite
imagery enables wide-area observation but lacks the fine-grained
interpretability of laboratory instruments. To bridge this gap, we introduce
DeepSalt, a deep-learning-based spectral transfer framework that leverages
knowledge distillation and a novel Spectral Adaptation Unit to transfer
high-resolution spectral insights from laboratory-based spectroscopy to
satellite-based hyperspectral sensing. Our approach eliminates the need for
extensive ground sampling while enabling accurate, large-scale salinity
estimation, as demonstrated through comprehensive empirical benchmarks.
DeepSalt achieves significant performance gains over methods without explicit
domain adaptation, underscoring the impact of the proposed Spectral Adaptation
Unit and the knowledge distillation strategy. The model also effectively
generalized to unseen geographic regions, explaining a substantial portion of
the salinity variance.

Motivation: 研究目的是统一Bigun与Granlund 1987年和Granlund与Knutsson 1995年提出的两种结构张量构建方法，展示它们在TLS线拟合下的内在联系，并优化张量构建过程。

Method: 通过TLS线拟合视角分析两种方法：一种是基于梯度响应外积平均，另一种是基于调谐频率向量外积加权。研究指出，后者引入的修正项在TLS框架下可省略。

Result: 结果表明，省略修正项可保证张量半正定，简化特征值解释，并允许使用非正交滤波器（如Gabor滤波器）及非角形网格分割。

Conclusion: 论文通过TLS统一视角，不仅简化了结构张量的构建与解释，还扩展了可用滤波器的类型和网格分割方式，提升了方法的灵活性与适用性。

Abstract: This note presents a theoretical discussion of two structure tensor
constructions: one proposed by Bigun and Granlund 1987, and the other by
Granlund and Knutsson 1995. At first glance, these approaches may appear quite
different--the former is implemented by averaging outer products of gradient
filter responses, while the latter constructs the tensor from weighted outer
products of tune-in frequency vectors of quadrature filters. We argue that when
both constructions are viewed through the common lens of Total Least Squares
(TLS) line fitting to the power spectrum, they can be reconciled to a large
extent, and additional benefits emerge. From this perspective, the correction
term introduced in Granlund and Knutsson 1995 becomes unnecessary. Omitting it
ensures that the resulting tensor remains positive semi-definite, thereby
simplifying the interpretation of its eigenvalues. Furthermore, this
interpretation allows fitting more than a single 0rientation to the input by
reinterpreting quadrature filter responses without relying on a structure
tensor. It also removes the constraint that responses must originate strictly
from quadrature filters, allowing the use of alternative filter types and
non-angular tessellations. These alternatives include Gabor filters--which,
although not strictly quadrature, are still suitable for structure tensor
construction--even when they tessellate the spectrum in a Cartesian fashion,
provided they are sufficiently concentrated.

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，方法在mAP和NDS指标上分别比基线提升了6.3%和4.3%。

Conclusion: DQ3D通过深度引导和混合查询机制有效提升了3D目标检测的性能，尤其是在复杂交通场景中。

Abstract: 3D object detection from multi-view images in traffic scenarios has garnered
significant attention in recent years. Many existing approaches rely on object
queries that are generated from 3D reference points to localize objects.
However, a limitation of these methods is that some reference points are often
far from the target object, which can lead to false positive detections. In
this paper, we propose a depth-guided query generator for 3D object detection
(DQ3D) that leverages depth information and 2D detections to ensure that
reference points are sampled from the surface or interior of the object.
Furthermore, to address partially occluded objects in current frame, we
introduce a hybrid attention mechanism that fuses historical detection results
with depth-guided queries, thereby forming hybrid queries. Evaluation on the
nuScenes dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms the baseline by 6.3\%
in terms of mean Average Precision (mAP) and 4.3\% in the NuScenes Detection
Score (NDS).

Motivation: 现有方法对新兴预训练模型的可迁移性评估不够准确，限制了预训练和微调范式的应用。因此，需要一种能适应多样化模型结构和任务对齐的新方法。

Method: 提出了隐式可迁移性建模（ITM）框架，结合分割与征服变分近似（DVA）策略，高效近似嵌入空间演化，以广泛适用于不同模型和任务。

Conclusion: ITM为预训练模型的可迁移性评估提供了一种更通用的解决方案，有助于推动预训练和微调范式的进一步发展。

Abstract: Transferability estimation identifies the best pre-trained models for
downstream tasks without incurring the high computational cost of full
fine-tuning. This capability facilitates deployment and advances the
pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, existing methods often struggle
to accurately assess transferability for emerging pre-trained models with
diverse architectures, training strategies, and task alignments. In this work,
we propose Implicit Transferability Modeling (ITM), a novel framework that
implicitly models each model's intrinsic transferability, coupled with a
Divide-and-Conquer Variational Approximation (DVA) strategy to efficiently
approximate embedding space evolution. This design enables generalization
across a broader range of models and downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on
a comprehensive benchmark--spanning extensive training regimes and a wider
variety of model types--demonstrate that ITM consistently outperforms existing
methods in terms of stability, effectiveness, and efficiency.

Abstract: Multimodal camera-LiDAR fusion technology has found extensive application in
3D object detection, demonstrating encouraging performance. However, existing
methods exhibit significant performance degradation in challenging scenarios
characterized by sensor degradation or environmental disturbances. We propose a
novel Adaptive Gated Fusion (AG-Fusion) approach that selectively integrates
cross-modal knowledge by identifying reliable patterns for robust detection in
complex scenes. Specifically, we first project features from each modality into
a unified BEV space and enhance them using a window-based attention mechanism.
Subsequently, an adaptive gated fusion module based on cross-modal attention is
designed to integrate these features into reliable BEV representations robust
to challenging environments. Furthermore, we construct a new dataset named
Excavator3D (E3D) focusing on challenging excavator operation scenarios to
benchmark performance in complex conditions. Our method not only achieves
competitive performance on the standard KITTI dataset with 93.92% accuracy, but
also significantly outperforms the baseline by 24.88% on the challenging E3D
dataset, demonstrating superior robustness to unreliable modal information in
complex industrial scenes.

Conclusion: 提出的零样本开放词汇方法有效解决了3D场景类比问题，提高了灵活性并支持多种应用。

Abstract: Connecting current observations with prior experiences helps robots adapt and
plan in new, unseen 3D environments. Recently, 3D scene analogies have been
proposed to connect two 3D scenes, which are smooth maps that align scene
regions with common spatial relationships. These maps enable detailed transfer
of trajectories or waypoints, potentially supporting demonstration transfer for
imitation learning or task plan transfer across scenes. However, existing
methods for the task require additional training and fixed object vocabularies.
In this work, we propose to use multimodal foundation models for finding 3D
scene analogies in a zero-shot, open-vocabulary setting. Central to our
approach is a hybrid neural representation of scenes that consists of a sparse
graph based on vision-language model features and a feature field derived from
3D shape foundation models. 3D scene analogies are then found in a
coarse-to-fine manner, by first aligning the graph and refining the
correspondence with feature fields. Our method can establish accurate
correspondences between complex scenes, and we showcase applications in
trajectory and waypoint transfer.

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型（VLMs）在零样本、语言基础任务中的空间推理能力，将其应用于异常动作识别，并评估了四种开源模型在隐私保护和提示条件下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着摄像头的广泛应用，视频数据量远超人类监控能力，亟需自动化方法及时检测异常或犯罪事件，以提升公共安全与安全保障。

Method: 研究将视频转化为文本描述，通过文本蕴含性评分标签，评估小型预训练视觉-语言模型（VLMs）作为空间基础的零样本异常检测器的能力。

Result: 研究表明，当前VLMs在简单、空间显著事件中表现良好，但在噪声空间线索和身份模糊情况下表现不佳，少量示例可提高准确性但可能增加误报。

Conclusion: 提出了无需任务特定训练即可增强空间基础的具体路径，如结构感知提示、跨片段的轻量级空间记忆等，为零样本语言基础管道在实时视频理解中的应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: The widespread use of cameras in our society has created an overwhelming
amount of video data, far exceeding the capacity for human monitoring. This
presents a critical challenge for public safety and security, as the timely
detection of anomalous or criminal events is crucial for effective response and
prevention. The ability for an embodied agent to recognize unexpected events is
fundamentally tied to its capacity for spatial reasoning. This paper
investigates the spatial reasoning of vision-language models (VLMs) by framing
anomalous action recognition as a zero-shot, language-grounded task, addressing
the embodied perception challenge of interpreting dynamic 3D scenes from sparse
2D video. Specifically, we investigate whether small, pre-trained vision--LLMs
can act as spatially-grounded, zero-shot anomaly detectors by converting video
into text descriptions and scoring labels via textual entailment. We evaluate
four open models on UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 under prompting and
privacy-preserving conditions. Few-shot exemplars can improve accuracy for some
models, but may increase false positives, and privacy filters -- especially
full-body GAN transforms -- introduce inconsistencies that degrade accuracy.
These results chart where current vision--LLMs succeed (simple, spatially
salient events) and where they falter (noisy spatial cues, identity
obfuscation). Looking forward, we outline concrete paths to strengthen spatial
grounding without task-specific training: structure-aware prompts, lightweight
spatial memory across clips, scene-graph or 3D-pose priors during description,
and privacy methods that preserve action-relevant geometry. This positions
zero-shot, language-grounded pipelines as adaptable building blocks for
embodied, real-world video understanding. Our implementation for evaluating
VLMs is publicly available at:

Motivation: 解决端到端自动驾驶系统在多样化车载摄像头视角下的鲁棒性问题。

Method: 提出VR-Drive框架，结合3D场景重建辅助任务，采用前馈推理策略、视角混合记忆库和视角一致性蒸馏策略。

Result: VR-Drive有效减少合成噪声并提升视角变化下的规划性能，发布了新的基准数据集。

Conclusion: VR-Drive为端到端自动驾驶系统的实际部署提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a promising paradigm
that unifies perception, prediction, and planning into a holistic, data-driven
framework. However, achieving robustness to varying camera viewpoints, a common
real-world challenge due to diverse vehicle configurations, remains an open
problem. In this work, we propose VR-Drive, a novel E2E-AD framework that
addresses viewpoint generalization by jointly learning 3D scene reconstruction
as an auxiliary task to enable planning-aware view synthesis. Unlike prior
scene-specific synthesis approaches, VR-Drive adopts a feed-forward inference
strategy that supports online training-time augmentation from sparse views
without additional annotations. To further improve viewpoint consistency, we
introduce a viewpoint-mixed memory bank that facilitates temporal interaction
across multiple viewpoints and a viewpoint-consistent distillation strategy
that transfers knowledge from original to synthesized views. Trained in a fully
end-to-end manner, VR-Drive effectively mitigates synthesis-induced noise and
improves planning under viewpoint shifts. In addition, we release a new
benchmark dataset to evaluate E2E-AD performance under novel camera viewpoints,
enabling comprehensive analysis. Our results demonstrate that VR-Drive is a
scalable and robust solution for the real-world deployment of end-to-end
autonomous driving systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字化病理切片的快速增长为临床和研究工作流提供了新的计算工具可能性，特别是基于内容的切片检索，可以帮助病理学家识别形态和语义相似的病例，提升诊断精确性和一致性。

Method: PathSearch框架结合了细粒度注意力马赛克表示和全球级幻灯片嵌入，通过视觉语言对比学习训练了6,926个幻灯片-报告对，支持图像到图像检索和多模态检索。

Result: PathSearch在四个公共病理数据集和三个内部队列中表现优异，优于传统图像检索框架，并通过多中心读者研究验证了其在临床场景中的实际效果。

Conclusion: PathSearch是一个可扩展且通用的数字病理检索解决方案，能够提高诊断准确性和观察者间一致性。

Abstract: The rapid digitization of histopathology slides has opened up new
possibilities for computational tools in clinical and research workflows. Among
these, content-based slide retrieval stands out, enabling pathologists to
identify morphologically and semantically similar cases, thereby supporting
precise diagnoses, enhancing consistency across observers, and assisting
example-based education. However, effective retrieval of whole slide images
(WSIs) remains challenging due to their gigapixel scale and the difficulty of
capturing subtle semantic differences amid abundant irrelevant content. To
overcome these challenges, we present PathSearch, a retrieval framework that
unifies fine-grained attentive mosaic representations with global-wise slide
embeddings aligned through vision-language contrastive learning. Trained on a
corpus of 6,926 slide-report pairs, PathSearch captures both fine-grained
morphological cues and high-level semantic patterns to enable accurate and
flexible retrieval. The framework supports two key functionalities: (1)
mosaic-based image-to-image retrieval, ensuring accurate and efficient slide
research; and (2) multi-modal retrieval, where text queries can directly
retrieve relevant slides. PathSearch was rigorously evaluated on four public
pathology datasets and three in-house cohorts, covering tasks including
anatomical site retrieval, tumor subtyping, tumor vs. non-tumor discrimination,
and grading across diverse organs such as breast, lung, kidney, liver, and
stomach. External results show that PathSearch outperforms traditional
image-to-image retrieval frameworks. A multi-center reader study further
demonstrates that PathSearch improves diagnostic accuracy, boosts confidence,
and enhances inter-observer agreement among pathologists in real clinical
scenarios. These results establish PathSearch as a scalable and generalizable
retrieval solution for digital pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中智能手机拍摄的屏幕内容常引入Moiré伪影，干扰深度伪造检测，但此问题研究较少。

Method: 收集12,832段视频数据集，涵盖多种条件；使用DMF数据集和两种合成Moiré生成技术进一步实验。

Result: Moiré伪影导致检测性能下降25.4%，合成Moiré模式降低准确性21.4%；去Moiré方法反而恶化问题（下降17.2%）。

Conclusion: 急需能鲁棒处理Moiré扭曲的检测模型；DMF数据集旨在弥合控制实验与实际检测间的差距。

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a pressing challenge, particularly in real-world
settings where smartphone-captured media from digital screens often introduces
Moir\'e artifacts that can distort detection outcomes. This study
systematically evaluates state-of-the-art (SOTA) deepfake detectors on
Moir\'e-affected videos, an issue that has received little attention. We
collected a dataset of 12,832 videos, spanning 35.64 hours, from the Celeb-DF,
DFD, DFDC, UADFV, and FF++ datasets, capturing footage under diverse real-world
conditions, including varying screens, smartphones, lighting setups, and camera
angles. To further examine the influence of Moir\'e patterns on deepfake
detection, we conducted additional experiments using our DeepMoir\'eFake,
referred to as (DMF) dataset and two synthetic Moir\'e generation techniques.
Across 15 top-performing detectors, our results show that Moir\'e artifacts
degrade performance by as much as 25.4%, while synthetically generated Moir\'e
patterns lead to a 21.4% drop in accuracy. Surprisingly, demoir\'eing methods,
intended as a mitigation approach, instead worsened the problem, reducing
accuracy by up to 17.2%. These findings underscore the urgent need for
detection models that can robustly handle Moir\'e distortions alongside other
realworld challenges, such as compression, sharpening, and blurring. By
introducing the DMF dataset, we aim to drive future research toward closing the
gap between controlled experiments and practical deepfake detection.

Motivation: 当前的HTG方法需要额外输入、缺乏停止机制且可能产生重复循环和视觉伪影，Eruku旨在解决这些问题并提升内容可控性。

Method: 将HTG重新定义为多模态提示条件生成任务，引入特殊文本输入令牌，并设计基于Classifier-Free-Guidance的自回归模型策略。

Result: Eruku方法比现有解决方案需要更少输入，对未见风格的泛化能力更强，且能更忠实地遵循文本提示。

Conclusion: Eruku有效解决了HTG中的内容控制性问题，提升了生成结果的忠实度和可读性。

Abstract: Generating faithful and readable styled text images (especially for Styled
Handwritten Text generation - HTG) is an open problem with several possible
applications across graphic design, document understanding, and image editing.
A lot of research effort in this task is dedicated to developing strategies
that reproduce the stylistic characteristics of a given writer, with promising
results in terms of style fidelity and generalization achieved by the recently
proposed Autoregressive Transformer paradigm for HTG. However, this method
requires additional inputs, lacks a proper stop mechanism, and might end up in
repetition loops, generating visual artifacts. In this work, we rethink the
autoregressive formulation by framing HTG as a multimodal prompt-conditioned
generation task, and tackle the content controllability issues by introducing
special textual input tokens for better alignment with the visual ones.
Moreover, we devise a Classifier-Free-Guidance-based strategy for our
autoregressive model. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate
that our approach, dubbed Eruku, compared to previous solutions requires fewer
inputs, generalizes better to unseen styles, and follows more faithfully the
textual prompt, improving content adherence.

Motivation: 为了解决3D医学图像分割中类别不平衡和训练效率低下的问题，作者提出了一种动态调整图像块大小的课程学习方法。

Method: 在训练过程中逐步增加图像块的大小，并在两种模式下评估：资源高效模式和性能模式。

Result: 资源高效模式在保持Dice评分性能的同时，将训练时间减少至44%；性能模式在Dice评分上取得1.28%的相对提升，并将训练时间减少至89%。

Conclusion: 该方法简单高效，不仅显著提升了分割性能和训练效率，还能适用于多种分割模型，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Progressive Growing of Patch Size, an automatic
curriculum learning approach for 3D medical image segmentation. Our approach
progressively increases the patch size during model training, resulting in an
improved class balance for smaller patch sizes and accelerated convergence of
the training process. We evaluate our curriculum approach in two settings: a
resource-efficient mode and a performance mode, both regarding Dice score
performance and computational costs across 15 diverse and popular 3D medical
image segmentation tasks. The resource-efficient mode matches the Dice score
performance of the conventional constant patch size sampling baseline with a
notable reduction in training time to only 44%. The performance mode improves
upon constant patch size segmentation results, achieving a statistically
significant relative mean performance gain of 1.28% in Dice Score. Remarkably,
across all 15 tasks, our proposed performance mode manages to surpass the
constant patch size baseline in Dice Score performance, while simultaneously
reducing training time to only 89%. The benefits are particularly pronounced
for highly imbalanced tasks such as lesion segmentation tasks. Rigorous
experiments demonstrate that our performance mode not only improves mean
segmentation performance but also reduces performance variance, yielding more
trustworthy model comparison. Furthermore, our findings reveal that the
proposed curriculum sampling is not tied to a specific architecture but
represents a broadly applicable strategy that consistently boosts performance
across diverse segmentation models, including UNet, UNETR, and SwinUNETR. In
summary, we show that this simple yet elegant transformation on input data
substantially improves both Dice Score performance and training runtime, while
being compatible across diverse segmentation backbones.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLMs）的广泛应用，研究如何衡量多模态模型的复杂性和方向是否正确变得重要。论文关注视频问答（VQA）任务中潜在的文本主导问题。

Method: 提出了一种基于Shapley值的联合方法，计算特征归因和模态分数，并在6种不同上下文长度的VLM模型上进行了比较，重点分析了视频、问题和答案三种模态的交互。

Result: 结果显示模型对文本的依赖性较强，且多选VQA任务退化为模型忽略干扰项的能力。

Conclusion: 研究表明当前VLMs仍存在文本主导问题，多模态交互有待进一步探索。

Abstract: As we become increasingly dependent on vision language models (VLMs) to
answer questions about the world around us, there is a significant amount of
research devoted to increasing both the difficulty of video question answering
(VQA) datasets, and the context lengths of the models that they evaluate. The
reliance on large language models as backbones has lead to concerns about
potential text dominance, and the exploration of interactions between
modalities is underdeveloped. How do we measure whether we're heading in the
right direction, with the complexity that multi-modal models introduce? We
propose a joint method of computing both feature attributions and modality
scores based on Shapley values, where both the features and modalities are
arbitrarily definable. Using these metrics, we compare $6$ VLM models of
varying context lengths on $4$ representative datasets, focusing on
multiple-choice VQA. In particular, we consider video frames and whole textual
elements as equal features in the hierarchy, and the multiple-choice VQA task
as an interaction between three modalities: video, question and answer. Our
results demonstrate a dependence on text and show that the multiple-choice VQA
task devolves into a model's ability to ignore distractors. Code available at

Motivation: 现实世界中的物体通常具有自然的层次化组织，这有助于提升分类任务的性能。传统CNN分类方法仅关注平面分类，忽略了这种层次关系，限制了上下文理解和错误控制的准确性。

Result: 模型在两种不同的层次化数据集分类上进行了训练和评估，结果表明该方法能够有效捕捉现实物体中的层次结构。

Conclusion: 论文提出的层次化分类方法优于传统平面分类算法，能够更好地利用物体的层次关系，提升分类性能。

Abstract: Current convolution neural network (CNN) classification methods are
predominantly focused on flat classification which aims solely to identify a
specified object within an image. However, real-world objects often possess a
natural hierarchical organization that can significantly help classification
tasks. Capturing the presence of relations between objects enables better
contextual understanding as well as control over the severity of mistakes.
Considering these aspects, this paper proposes an end-to-end hierarchical model
for image detection and classification built upon the YOLO model family. A
novel hierarchical architecture, a modified loss function, and a performance
metric tailored to the hierarchical nature of the model are introduced. The
proposed model is trained and evaluated on two different hierarchical
categorizations of the same dataset: a systematic categorization that
disregards visual similarities between objects and a categorization accounting
for common visual characteristics across classes. The results illustrate how
the suggested methodology addresses the inherent hierarchical structure present
in real-world objects, which conventional flat classification algorithms often
overlook.

Abstract: Diffusion-based generative processes, formulated as differential equation
solving, frequently balance computational speed with sample quality. Our
theoretical investigation of ODE- and SDE-based solvers reveals complementary
weaknesses: ODE solvers accumulate irreducible gradient error along
deterministic trajectories, while SDE methods suffer from amplified
discretization errors when the step budget is limited. Building upon this
insight, we introduce AdaSDE, a novel single-step SDE solver that aims to unify
the efficiency of ODEs with the error resilience of SDEs. Specifically, we
introduce a single per-step learnable coefficient, estimated via lightweight
distillation, which dynamically regulates the error correction strength to
accelerate diffusion sampling. Notably, our framework can be integrated with
existing solvers to enhance their capabilities. Extensive experiments
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: at 5 NFE, AdaSDE achieves FID scores
of 4.18 on CIFAR-10, 8.05 on FFHQ and 6.96 on LSUN Bedroom. Codes are available

Method: 1.引入MMSD3.0数据集，完全由多图像样本构成；2.提出CIRM模型，通过跨图像序列建模捕获图像间潜在联系；3.基于文本-图像对应性设计细粒度跨模态融合机制，减少信息损失。

Conclusion: MMSD3.0填补了多图像讽刺检测研究的空白，CIRM模型的跨图像建模能力显著提升了检测效果。

Abstract: Despite progress in multimodal sarcasm detection, existing datasets and
methods predominantly focus on single-image scenarios, overlooking potential
semantic and affective relations across multiple images. This leaves a gap in
modeling cases where sarcasm is triggered by multi-image cues in real-world
settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce MMSD3.0, a new benchmark composed
entirely of multi-image samples curated from tweets and Amazon reviews. We
further propose the Cross-Image Reasoning Model (CIRM), which performs targeted
cross-image sequence modeling to capture latent inter-image connections. In
addition, we introduce a relevance-guided, fine-grained cross-modal fusion
mechanism based on text-image correspondence to reduce information loss during
integration. We establish a comprehensive suite of strong and representative
baselines and conduct extensive experiments, showing that MMSD3.0 is an
effective and reliable benchmark that better reflects real-world conditions.
Moreover, CIRM demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across MMSD, MMSD2.0
and MMSD3.0, validating its effectiveness in both single-image and multi-image
scenarios.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法大多假设模态匹配条件，忽视了实际应用中模态不一致的问题，限制了其鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: MDReID通过模态解耦学习（MDL）分解模态特征为共享和特定部分，并通过模态感知度量学习（MML）增强跨模态的判别力。

Result: 在三个多模态重识别基准测试中，MDReID在模态匹配和不匹配场景下分别取得了显著的mAP提升。

Conclusion: MDReID通过有效处理模态不一致性，展示了在多模态重识别任务中的优越性和实用性。

Abstract: Real-world object re-identification (ReID) systems often face modality
inconsistencies, where query and gallery images come from different sensors
(e.g., RGB, NIR, TIR). However, most existing methods assume modality-matched
conditions, which limits their robustness and scalability in practical
applications. To address this challenge, we propose MDReID, a flexible
any-to-any image-level ReID framework designed to operate under both
modality-matched and modality-mismatched scenarios. MDReID builds on the
insight that modality information can be decomposed into two components:
modality-shared features that are predictable and transferable, and
modality-specific features that capture unique, modality-dependent
characteristics. To effectively leverage this, MDReID introduces two key
components: the Modality Decoupling Learning (MDL) and Modality-aware Metric
Learning (MML). Specifically, MDL explicitly decomposes modality features into
modality-shared and modality-specific representations, enabling effective
retrieval in both modality-aligned and mismatched scenarios. MML, a tailored
metric learning strategy, further enforces orthogonality and complementarity
between the two components to enhance discriminative power across modalities.
Extensive experiments conducted on three challenging multi-modality ReID
benchmarks (RGBNT201, RGBNT100, MSVR310) consistently demonstrate the
superiority of MDReID. Notably, MDReID achieves significant mAP improvements of
9.8\%, 3.0\%, and 11.5\% in general modality-matched scenarios, and average
gains of 3.4\%, 11.8\%, and 10.9\% in modality-mismatched scenarios,
respectively. The code is available at:

Conclusion: ReconViaGen有效解决了3D生成方法在多视图重建中的一致性挑战，提升了重建效果。

Abstract: Existing multi-view 3D object reconstruction methods heavily rely on
sufficient overlap between input views, where occlusions and sparse coverage in
practice frequently yield severe reconstruction incompleteness. Recent
advancements in diffusion-based 3D generative techniques offer the potential to
address these limitations by leveraging learned generative priors to
hallucinate invisible parts of objects, thereby generating plausible 3D
structures. However, the stochastic nature of the inference process limits the
accuracy and reliability of generation results, preventing existing
reconstruction frameworks from integrating such 3D generative priors. In this
work, we comprehensively analyze the reasons why diffusion-based 3D generative
methods fail to achieve high consistency, including (a) the insufficiency in
constructing and leveraging cross-view connections when extracting multi-view
image features as conditions, and (b) the poor controllability of iterative
denoising during local detail generation, which easily leads to plausible but
inconsistent fine geometric and texture details with inputs. Accordingly, we
propose ReconViaGen to innovatively integrate reconstruction priors into the
generative framework and devise several strategies that effectively address
these issues. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReconViaGen can
reconstruct complete and accurate 3D models consistent with input views in both
global structure and local details.Project page:

Abstract: Medical image analysis is central to drug discovery and preclinical
evaluation, where scalable, objective readouts can accelerate decision-making.
We address classification of paclitaxel (Taxol) exposure from phase-contrast
microscopy of C6 glioma cells -- a task with subtle dose differences that
challenges full-image models. We propose a simple tiling-and-aggregation
pipeline that operates on local patches and combines tile outputs into an image
label, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the benchmark dataset and
improving over the published baseline by around 20 percentage points, with
trends confirmed by cross-validation. To understand why tiling is effective, we
further apply Grad-CAM and Score-CAM and attention analyses, which enhance
model interpretability and point toward robustness-oriented directions for
future medical image research. Code is released to facilitate reproduction and
extension.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarTrack是一个大规模、高质量且具有挑战性的平面跟踪基准数据集，包含1150个序列和733K帧，旨在促进平面跟踪技术的发展，并在真实场景中评估跟踪器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏大规模平台，平面跟踪技术的发展受到限制，尤其是在深度学习时代。为了弥补这一缺陷，作者提出了PlanarTrack基准数据集。

Method: PlanarTrack包含1150个序列，其中1000个短期视频和150个长期视频，所有视频均来自真实场景，并经过多轮手动标注和精细检查。

Result: PlanarTrack是目前最大、最多样化和最具挑战性的平面跟踪数据集，评估结果表明现有跟踪器在该数据集上表现不佳。

Conclusion: PlanarTrack为平面跟踪研究提供了重要的基准资源，未来仍需更多努力提升跟踪性能。

Abstract: Planar tracking has drawn increasing interest owing to its key roles in
robotics and augmented reality. Despite recent great advancement, further
development of planar tracking, particularly in the deep learning era, is
largely limited compared to generic tracking due to the lack of large-scale
platforms. To mitigate this, we propose PlanarTrack, a large-scale high-quality
and challenging benchmark for planar tracking. Specifically, PlanarTrack
consists of 1,150 sequences with over 733K frames, including 1,000 short-term
and 150 new long-term videos, which enables comprehensive evaluation of short-
and long-term tracking performance. All videos in PlanarTrack are recorded in
unconstrained conditions from the wild, which makes PlanarTrack challenging but
more realistic for real-world applications. To ensure high-quality annotations,
each video frame is manually annotated by four corner points with multi-round
meticulous inspection and refinement. To enhance target diversity of
PlanarTrack, we only capture a unique target in one sequence, which is
different from existing benchmarks. To our best knowledge, PlanarTrack is by
far the largest and most diverse and challenging dataset dedicated to planar
tracking. To understand performance of existing methods on PlanarTrack and to
provide a comparison for future research, we evaluate 10 representative planar
trackers with extensive comparison and in-depth analysis. Our evaluation
reveals that, unsurprisingly, the top planar trackers heavily degrade on the
challenging PlanarTrack, which indicates more efforts are required for
improving planar tracking. Our data and results will be released at

### [151] [An Efficient Remote Sensing Super Resolution Method Exploring Diffusion Priors and Multi-Modal Constraints for Crop Type Mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23382)
*Songxi Yang,Tang Sui,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种高效的LSSR框架用于遥感图像超分辨率（RSSR），结合了多模态数据、预训练模型和辅助信息，显著提升了图像重建质量和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决扩散模型在RSSR中训练成本高、推理速度慢的问题，同时提高辅助信息的利用率和下游任务的评估能力。

Method: 基于预训练的Stable Diffusion，引入跨模态注意力机制、辅助知识（DEM、土地覆盖、月份）和SAR引导，通过适配器和傅里叶NDVI损失优化空间细节与光谱保真度。

Result: LSSR在RGB和IR指标上表现优异（PSNR/SSIM: 32.63/0.84和23.99/0.78），NDVI误差最低（0.042），推理速度快（0.39秒/图），下游作物分类F1达0.86。

Conclusion: LSSR框架展示了RSSR在精准农业中的潜力，提升了图像重建质量和下游任务效果。

Abstract: Super resolution offers a way to harness medium even lowresolution but
historically valuable remote sensing image archives. Generative models,
especially diffusion models, have recently been applied to remote sensing super
resolution (RSSR), yet several challenges exist. First, diffusion models are
effective but require expensive training from scratch resources and have slow
inference speeds. Second, current methods have limited utilization of auxiliary
information as real-world constraints to reconstruct scientifically realistic
images. Finally, most current methods lack evaluation on downstream tasks. In
this study, we present a efficient LSSR framework for RSSR, supported by a new
multimodal dataset of paired 30 m Landsat 8 and 10 m Sentinel 2 imagery. Built
on frozen pretrained Stable Diffusion, LSSR integrates crossmodal attention
with auxiliary knowledge (Digital Elevation Model, land cover, month) and
Synthetic Aperture Radar guidance, enhanced by adapters and a tailored Fourier
NDVI loss to balance spatial details and spectral fidelity. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that LSSR significantly improves crop boundary
delineation and recovery, achieving state-of-the-art performance with Peak
Signal-to-Noise Ratio/Structural Similarity Index Measure of 32.63/0.84 (RGB)
and 23.99/0.78 (IR), and the lowest NDVI Mean Squared Error (0.042), while
maintaining efficient inference (0.39 sec/image). Moreover, LSSR transfers
effectively to NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel (HLS) super resolution,
yielding more reliable crop classification (F1: 0.86) than Sentinel-2 (F1:
0.85). These results highlight the potential of RSSR to advance precision
agriculture.

accordance with the existing Autocolorization direction model DDColor. For the
experiments on the existing weights of DDColor, we found that it has
limitations in some frequency bands and the color cast problem caused by
insufficient input dimension. We construct two optimization schemes and combine
them, which achieves the performance improvement of indicators such as PSNR and
SSIM of the images after DDColor.

Abstract: Unlike image or text domains that benefit from an abundance of large-scale
datasets, point cloud learning techniques frequently encounter limitations due
to the scarcity of extensive datasets. To overcome this limitation, we present
Symmetria, a formula-driven dataset that can be generated at any arbitrary
scale. By construction, it ensures the absolute availability of precise ground
truth, promotes data-efficient experimentation by requiring fewer samples,
enables broad generalization across diverse geometric settings, and offers easy
extensibility to new tasks and modalities. Using the concept of symmetry, we
create shapes with known structure and high variability, enabling neural
networks to learn point cloud features effectively. Our results demonstrate
that this dataset is highly effective for point cloud self-supervised
pre-training, yielding models with strong performance in downstream tasks such
as classification and segmentation, which also show good few-shot learning
capabilities. Additionally, our dataset can support fine-tuning models to
classify real-world objects, highlighting our approach's practical utility and
application. We also introduce a challenging task for symmetry detection and
provide a benchmark for baseline comparisons. A significant advantage of our
approach is the public availability of the dataset, the accompanying code, and
the ability to generate very large collections, promoting further research and
innovation in point cloud learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的医学影像分析方法通常依赖标记数据和单切片范式，限制了其在多模态和标签稀缺场景中的性能。BrainFound旨在通过自监督学习和3D建模克服这些限制。

Method: 通过扩展DINO-v2视觉变换器，BrainFound建模3D脑解剖结构，支持单模态和多模态输入，并应用于多种下游任务。

Result: BrainFound在标签稀缺和多对比度的场景中表现优于现有自监督和监督基线方法，显著提高了诊断准确性。

Conclusion: BrainFound是一种灵活且可扩展的3D神经影像解决方案，具有临床部署和研究创新的潜力。

Abstract: Foundation models in artificial intelligence (AI) are transforming medical
imaging by enabling general-purpose feature learning from large-scale,
unlabeled datasets. In this work, we introduce BrainFound, a self-supervised
foundation model for brain MRI, built by extending DINO-v2, a vision
transformer originally designed for 2D natural images. BrainFound adapts
DINO-v2 to model full 3D brain anatomy by incorporating volumetric information
from sequential MRI slices, moving beyond conventional single-slice paradigms.
It supports both single- and multimodal inputs, enabling a broad range of
downstream tasks, including disease detection and image segmentation, while
generalising across varied imaging protocols and clinical scenarios. We show
that BrainFound consistently outperforms existing self-supervised pretraining
strategies and supervised baselines, particularly in label-scarce and
multi-contrast settings. By integrating information from diverse 3D MRI
modalities (e.g., T1, T2, FLAIR), it enhances diagnostic accuracy and reduces
dependency on extensive expert annotations. This flexibility makes BrainFound a
scalable and practical solution for 3D neuroimaging pipelines, with significant
potential for clinical deployment and research innovation.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种新颖的工作流程，用于高效准确地将大规模移动激光扫描点云注册到目标模型点云中，应用于城市街道场景。通过SSC预处理技术和PV-GICP精细注册方法，显著提高了精度并减少了计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市环境中点云注册面临密度、噪声和遮挡等复杂挑战，需要一种高效且准确的解决方案来支持自动化3D城市建模和更新。

Method: 1. 引入SSC预处理技术，通过识别正交平面分割轨迹数据，减少点云漂移影响；2. 提出PV-GICP精细注册方法，利用体素分区内的平面表面提升精度并降低计算时间。

Result: 实验结果显示，平均注册精度达到亚0.01米，同时计算时间减少50%以上。

Conclusion: 该工作流程在城市规划和基础设施管理等领域具有直接应用潜力，为自动化3D城市建模提供了有效的技术支持。

Abstract: This study presents a novel workflow designed to efficiently and accurately
register large-scale mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds to a target model
point cloud in urban street scenarios. This workflow specifically targets the
complexities inherent in urban environments and adeptly addresses the
challenges of integrating point clouds that vary in density, noise
characteristics, and occlusion scenarios, which are common in bustling city
centers. Two methodological advancements are introduced. First, the proposed
Semi-sphere Check (SSC) preprocessing technique optimally fragments MLS
trajectory data by identifying mutually orthogonal planar surfaces. This step
reduces the impact of MLS drift on the accuracy of the entire point cloud
registration, while ensuring sufficient geometric features within each fragment
to avoid local minima. Second, we propose Planar Voxel-based Generalized
Iterative Closest Point (PV-GICP), a fine registration method that selectively
utilizes planar surfaces within voxel partitions. This pre-process strategy not
only improves registration accuracy but also reduces computation time by more
than 50% compared to conventional point-to-plane ICP methods. Experiments on
real-world datasets from Munich's inner city demonstrate that our workflow
achieves sub-0.01 m average registration accuracy while significantly
shortening processing times. The results underscore the potential of the
proposed methods to advance automated 3D urban modeling and updating, with
direct applications in urban planning, infrastructure management, and dynamic
city monitoring.

Motivation: CAD逆向工程面临高精度和结构复杂性的挑战，现有深度学习方法要么无法生成完全参数化输出，要么忽略几何细节和草图级约束。

Method: 受人类设计师手动操作的启发，采用多平面截面提取2D图案的方法，更有效地捕捉参数细节，并融入草图约束。

Result: 该方法能够重建详细且可编辑的CAD模型，性能优于现有方法，并首次实现了草图约束的直接整合。

Conclusion: 该方法为CAD逆向工程提供了更高效的解决方案，结合了参数化细节和草图约束，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) plays a foundational role in modern manufacturing
and product development, often requiring designers to modify or build upon
existing models. Converting 3D scans into parametric CAD representations--a
process known as CAD reverse engineering--remains a significant challenge due
to the high precision and structural complexity of CAD models. Existing deep
learning-based approaches typically fall into two categories: bottom-up,
geometry-driven methods, which often fail to produce fully parametric outputs,
and top-down strategies, which tend to overlook fine-grained geometric details.
Moreover, current methods neglect an essential aspect of CAD modeling:
sketch-level constraints. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to CAD
reverse engineering inspired by how human designers manually perform the task.
Our method leverages multi-plane cross-sections to extract 2D patterns and
capture fine parametric details more effectively. It enables the reconstruction
of detailed and editable CAD models, outperforming state-of-the-art methods
and, for the first time, incorporating sketch constraints directly into the
reconstruction process.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低光照条件下的视觉任务因光照退化问题表现不佳，现有方法对低光照条件建模不完整，需要更好的解决方案。

Method: 论文扩展了经典的Lambertian模型，利用频域通道比率提取光照不变特征，并提出FRBNet模块，结合可学习的频域滤波器。

Result: 实验表明，FRBNet在多个下游任务中表现优越，检测任务mAP提升2.2，夜间分割任务mIoU提升2.9。

Conclusion: FRBNet作为即插即用模块，显著提升了低光照条件下的视觉任务性能，无需修改损失函数。

Abstract: Low-light vision remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision due to
severe illumination degradation, which significantly affects the performance of
downstream tasks such as detection and segmentation. While recent
state-of-the-art methods have improved performance through invariant feature
learning modules, they still fall short due to incomplete modeling of low-light
conditions. Therefore, we revisit low-light image formation and extend the
classical Lambertian model to better characterize low-light conditions. By
shifting our analysis to the frequency domain, we theoretically prove that the
frequency-domain channel ratio can be leveraged to extract
illumination-invariant features via a structured filtering process. We then
propose a novel and end-to-end trainable module named \textbf{F}requency-domain
\textbf{R}adial \textbf{B}asis \textbf{Net}work (\textbf{FRBNet}), which
integrates the frequency-domain channel ratio operation with a learnable
frequency domain filter for the overall illumination-invariant feature
enhancement. As a plug-and-play module, FRBNet can be integrated into existing
networks for low-light downstream tasks without modifying loss functions.
Extensive experiments across various downstream tasks demonstrate that FRBNet
achieves superior performance, including +2.2 mAP for dark object detection and
+2.9 mIoU for nighttime segmentation. Code is available at:

Motivation: 尽管“Thinking with Images”在多模态大型语言模型中取得成功，但其动态推理范式尚未扩展到视频推理任务。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 构建了Video-Thinker-10K数据集，通过监督微调（SFT）和组相对策略优化（GRPO）训练模型，使其能自主生成推理线索。

Result: Video-Thinker在多个视频推理基准测试中表现优异，优于现有基线模型（如Video-R1），并在7B大小的MLLMs中树立了新标准。

Conclusion: Video-Thinker展示了MLLMs在视频推理任务中的强大潜力，其自主能力显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in image reasoning methods, particularly "Thinking with
Images", have demonstrated remarkable success in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs); however, this dynamic reasoning paradigm has not yet been
extended to video reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Video-Thinker,
which empowers MLLMs to think with videos by autonomously leveraging their
intrinsic "grounding" and "captioning" capabilities to generate reasoning clues
throughout the inference process. To spark this capability, we construct
Video-Thinker-10K, a curated dataset featuring autonomous tool usage within
chain-of-thought reasoning sequences. Our training strategy begins with
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to learn the reasoning format, followed by Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to strengthen this reasoning capability.
Through this approach, Video-Thinker enables MLLMs to autonomously navigate
grounding and captioning tasks for video reasoning, eliminating the need for
constructing and calling external tools. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
Video-Thinker achieves significant performance gains on both in-domain tasks
and challenging out-of-domain video reasoning benchmarks, including
Video-Holmes, CG-Bench-Reasoning, and VRBench. Our Video-Thinker-7B
substantially outperforms existing baselines such as Video-R1 and establishes
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-sized MLLMs.

Conclusion: UrbanIng-V2X为多样化交通环境下的协作感知研究提供了重要资源，公开了数据集、代码库和数字孪生环境。

Abstract: Recent cooperative perception datasets have played a crucial role in
advancing smart mobility applications by enabling information exchange between
intelligent agents, helping to overcome challenges such as occlusions and
improving overall scene understanding. While some existing real-world datasets
incorporate both vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure interactions,
they are typically limited to a single intersection or a single vehicle. A
comprehensive perception dataset featuring multiple connected vehicles and
infrastructure sensors across several intersections remains unavailable,
limiting the benchmarking of algorithms in diverse traffic environments.
Consequently, overfitting can occur, and models may demonstrate misleadingly
high performance due to similar intersection layouts and traffic participant
behavior. To address this gap, we introduce UrbanIng-V2X, the first
large-scale, multi-modal dataset supporting cooperative perception involving
vehicles and infrastructure sensors deployed across three urban intersections
in Ingolstadt, Germany. UrbanIng-V2X consists of 34 temporally aligned and
spatially calibrated sensor sequences, each lasting 20 seconds. All sequences
contain recordings from one of three intersections, involving two vehicles and
up to three infrastructure-mounted sensor poles operating in coordinated
scenarios. In total, UrbanIng-V2X provides data from 12 vehicle-mounted RGB
cameras, 2 vehicle LiDARs, 17 infrastructure thermal cameras, and 12
infrastructure LiDARs. All sequences are annotated at a frequency of 10 Hz with
3D bounding boxes spanning 13 object classes, resulting in approximately 712k
annotated instances across the dataset. We provide comprehensive evaluations
using state-of-the-art cooperative perception methods and publicly release the
codebase, dataset, HD map, and a digital twin of the complete data collection
environment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出MergeMix方法，通过结合监督微调和强化学习的优点，解决多模态大语言模型视觉语言对齐的可扩展性、鲁棒性和对齐质量之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言对齐方法（如SFT和RL）各有优劣，SFT稳定但依赖人工标注，RL引入奖励信号但存在不稳定问题。MergeMix旨在结合两者的优势，提升训练效率和效果。

Method: MergeMix提出一种训练时增强方法，包括基于注意力感知的图像混合和偏好驱动训练范式，使用SimPO损失优化。

Result: 实验表明，MergeMix在分类任务中表现优于其他启发式方法，并在效率和准确性上达到竞争性结果。

Conclusion: MergeMix为多模态大语言模型的偏好对齐提供了一种可扩展且高效的方法。

Abstract: Vision-language alignment in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs)
typically relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning
(RL). SFT is stable and efficient but requires large-scale human annotations
and cannot capture subtle preferences, while RL brings in a reward signal for
training, but suffers from overhead and instability. These limitations
highlight a trade-off between scalability, robustness, and alignment quality.
To address this, we propose MergeMix, a training-time augmentation paradigm
that bridges SFT and RL. It first applies an attention-aware image mixing via
token merge with more cluster representation and spatial context, and then
presents a preference-driven training paradigm for MLLMs by building preference
pairs with mixed images and raw images, and optimizing via SimPO loss. As a
mixup augmentation, MergeMix enhances attention consistency and efficiency,
surpassing other heuristic-based methods in classification. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MergeMix achieves competitive accuracy with
improved efficiency, providing a scalable approach to preference alignment in
classification and MLLMs.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文发现大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）生成的多模态思维链（MCoT）中的视觉信息不准确但答案正确，提出了一种无需标注的学习策略SCCM来改进视觉信息的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型视觉语言模型生成的多模态思维链（MCoT）中，视觉信息通常不准确却仍能得到正确答案，表明推理过程缺乏忠诚度。这种不忠实源于强化微调（RFT）中的奖励机制，仅鼓励穿插视觉-文本线索的形式，但不关注视觉信息的正确性。

Method: 作者首先通过干预视觉和文本思维探测MCoT的忠诚度，发现视觉干预对预测影响很小；随后提出自动化评估指标量化视觉信息的可靠性和充分性；最终提出了SCCM学习策略，鼓励生成独立足够的最小视觉组件以提升忠诚度。

Result: 实验证明，SCCM在一系列细粒度感知和推理任务中显著提升了视觉信息的忠诚度。

Conclusion: SCCM是一种无需标注且可即插即用的方法，能够有效改进多模态思维链中视觉信息的忠实性。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) can generate vision-text
multimodal chain-of-thought (MCoT) traces after reinforcement fine-tuning
(RFT). However, we observe that the visual information incorporated in MCoT is
often inaccurate, though still yield correct answers, indicating a lack of
faithfulness in the MCoT reasoning process. We attribute this unfaithfulness to
the RL reward in RFT, which solely incentivizes the format of interleaved
vision-text cues, ie, it encourages the model to incorporate visual information
into its text reasoning steps without considering the correctness of the visual
information. In this paper, we first probe the faithfulness of MCoT by
measuring how much the prediction changes when its visual and textual thoughts
are intervened. Surprisingly, the model's predictions remain nearly unchanged
under visual intervention but change significantly under textual intervention,
indicating that the visual evidence is largely ignored. To further analyze
visual information, we introduce an automated LVLM-based evaluation metric that
quantifies the faithfulness of visual cues from two perspectives: reliability
and sufficiency. Our evaluation reveals that the visual information in current
MCoT traces is simultaneously unreliable and insufficient. To address this
issue, we propose a novel MCoT learning strategy termed Sufficient-Component
Cause Model (SCCM) learning. This approach encourages the MCoT to generate
sufficient yet minimal visual components that are independently capable of
leading to correct answers. We note that the proposed SCCM is annotation-free
and compatible with various RFT for MCoT in a plug-and-play manner. Empirical
results demonstrate that SCCM consistently improves the visual faithfulness
across a suite of fine-grained perception and reasoning benchmarks. Code is

*Walid Bousselham,Hilde Kuehne,Cordelia Schmid*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VOLD框架通过强化学习和策略蒸馏，将文本推理能力迁移到视觉语言模型中，显著提升推理性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高质量图像-文本推理数据稀缺，而文本推理资源丰富且可扩展，但如何利用这些资源提升视觉语言模型的推理能力尚未解决。

Method: VOLD结合GRPO强化学习和策略蒸馏，通过教师模型指导学生模型的推理路径，并使用冷启动对齐确保有效迁移。

Result: VOLD在MMMU-Pro等多项基准测试中显著优于基线模型，并超越现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 冷启动对齐对基于文本教师的策略蒸馏至关重要，VOLD为视觉语言模型的复杂推理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Training vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning remains a
challenging task, i.a. due to the scarcity of high-quality image-text reasoning
data. Conversely, text-based reasoning resources are abundant and scalable, but
it is still an open question how to leveraging them for VLM reasoning. To
address this problem, we propose VOLD, a framework to transfer reasoning
capabilities from text-only teacher models to VLM student models. To this end,
VOLD combines reinforcement learning via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with on-policy distillation, which allows the student reasoning traces
to be guided by the teacher model, resulting in a significant gain over using
GRPO alone. We further show that a cold-start alignment is essential for an
effective transfer during the online training phase in this scenario and that
without sufficient distributional alignment between teacher and student,
on-policy distillation fails to provide meaningful guidance. We evaluate VOLD
across diverse benchmarks including MMMU-Pro, MathVision, MathVista, and
LogicVista, showing that VOLD outperforms the baseline model significantly and
improves over the state of the art by a margin. Our ablation shows the
importance of a cold-start alignment via SFT for on-policy distillation with a
text-only teacher.

*Yaoli Liu,Yao-Xiang Ding,Kun Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FreeFuse是一种无需训练的多主体文本到图像生成方法，通过自动融合多个主体LoRA实现高效生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖预推理LoRA权重合并或复杂的分割模型，而FreeFuse旨在通过动态主体掩码简化多主体生成流程。

Method: 利用交叉注意力层权重自动生成上下文感知的动态主体掩码，并将其应用于LoRA输出。

Result: FreeFuse在生成质量和实用性上优于现有方法，且无需额外训练或修改LoRA。

Conclusion: FreeFuse展示了高效、实用的多主体生成能力，适合标准工作流无缝集成。

Abstract: This paper proposes FreeFuse, a novel training-free approach for
multi-subject text-to-image generation through automatic fusion of multiple
subject LoRAs. In contrast to existing methods that either focus on
pre-inference LoRA weight merging or rely on segmentation models and complex
techniques like noise blending to isolate LoRA outputs, our key insight is that
context-aware dynamic subject masks can be automatically derived from
cross-attention layer weights. Mathematical analysis shows that directly
applying these masks to LoRA outputs during inference well approximates the
case where the subject LoRA is integrated into the diffusion model and used
individually for the masked region. FreeFuse demonstrates superior practicality
and efficiency as it requires no additional training, no modification to LoRAs,
no auxiliary models, and no user-defined prompt templates or region
specifications. Alternatively, it only requires users to provide the LoRA
activation words for seamless integration into standard workflows. Extensive
experiments validate that FreeFuse outperforms existing approaches in both
generation quality and usability under the multi-subject generation tasks. The

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了动态伪标签过滤（DPLF）和先验引导数据增强管道（PG-DAP），以优化点云语义分割中的非监督域适应（UDA）性能。通过实验验证了方法的优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 真实LiDAR点云的标注成本高昂，现有方法在利用无标签数据时表现不佳。

Method: 提出DPLF增强无标签数据利用，设计PG-DAP减轻域偏移，使用数据混合一致性损失学习上下文无关表示。

Result: 在两个合成到真实点云任务中表现优于现有方法，消融实验验证了模块有效性。

Conclusion: DPLF和PG-DAP显著提升了点云UDA语义分割的性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Annotating real-world LiDAR point clouds for use in intelligent autonomous
systems is costly. To overcome this limitation, self-training-based
Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) has been widely used to improve point
cloud semantic segmentation by leveraging synthetic point cloud data. However,
we argue that existing methods do not effectively utilize unlabeled data, as
they either rely on predefined or fixed confidence thresholds, resulting in
suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Pseudo-Label
Filtering (DPLF) scheme to enhance real data utilization in point cloud UDA
semantic segmentation. Additionally, we design a simple and efficient
Prior-Guided Data Augmentation Pipeline (PG-DAP) to mitigate domain shift
between synthetic and real-world point clouds. Finally, we utilize data mixing
consistency loss to push the model to learn context-free representations. We
implement and thoroughly evaluate our approach through extensive comparisons
with state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on two challenging synthetic-to-real
point cloud semantic segmentation tasks demonstrate that our approach achieves
superior performance. Ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of the DPLF
and PG-DAP modules. We release the code of our method in this paper.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为EgoThinker的新框架，通过时空思维链监督和两阶段学习课程，赋予多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）强大的自我中心推理能力，显著提升了细粒度时空定位任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型虽擅长可见事件的推理，但缺乏对自我中心视角的动态环境和隐含意图的理解能力，限制了其在自我中心视频推理任务中的应用。

Method: 研究者首先构建了大规模自我中心问答数据集EgoRe-5M，包含13M个多样化的自我中心视频片段；随后通过监督式微调（SFT）和强化微调（RFT）的两阶段学习课程，增强模型的时空定位能力。

Result: 实验表明，EgoThinker在多个自我中心基准测试中表现优于现有方法，尤其是在细粒度时空定位任务上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: EgoThinker成功填补了现有MLLMs在自我中心推理能力上的不足，为未来相关研究提供了有效工具和数据集。

Abstract: Egocentric video reasoning centers on an unobservable agent behind the camera
who dynamically shapes the environment, requiring inference of hidden
intentions and recognition of fine-grained interactions. This core challenge
limits current multimodal large language models MLLMs, which excel at visible
event reasoning but lack embodied, first-person understanding. To bridge this
gap, we introduce EgoThinker, a novel framework that endows MLLMs with robust
egocentric reasoning capabilities through spatio-temporal chain-of-thought
supervision and a two-stage learning curriculum. First, we introduce EgoRe-5M,
a large-scale egocentric QA dataset constructed from 13M diverse egocentric
video clips. This dataset features multi-minute segments annotated with
detailed CoT rationales and dense hand-object grounding. Second, we employ SFT
on EgoRe-5M to instill reasoning skills, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning
RFT to further enhance spatio-temporal localization. Experimental results show
that EgoThinker outperforms existing methods across multiple egocentric
benchmarks, while achieving substantial improvements in fine-grained
spatio-temporal localization tasks. Full code and data are released at

TL;DR: MERGE是一个统一的图像生成和深度估计模型，基于预训练的文本到图像扩散模型，实现了两种任务的轻松切换，同时保持了原有的图像生成能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决预训练模型在训练过程中因参数更新导致的图像生成能力退化问题，同时扩展其功能至深度估计，提出了MERGE模型。

Method: MERGE采用即插即用框架和组重用机制，通过简单的转换器实现图像生成与深度估计模式的切换，并优化参数利用率。

Result: MERGE在多个深度估计基准测试中达到了最先进的性能，同时保持了原有的图像生成能力。

Conclusion: MERGE展示了预训练文本到图像模型的强大潜力，不仅能生成图像，还能扩展到深度估计任务，且性能优异。

Abstract: Generative depth estimation methods leverage the rich visual priors stored in
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, demonstrating astonishing zero-shot
capability. However, parameter updates during training lead to catastrophic
degra- dation in the image generation capability of the pre-trained model. We
introduce MERGE, a unified model for image generation and depth estimation,
starting from a fixed pre-trained text-to-image model. MERGE demonstrates that
the pre-trained text-to-image model can do more than image generation, but also
expand to depth estimation effortlessly. Specifically, MERGE introduces a play-
and-plug framework that enables seamless switching between image generation and
depth estimation modes through simple and pluggable converters. Meanwhile, we
propose a Group Reuse Mechanism to encourage parameter reuse and im- prove the
utilization of the additional learnable parameters. MERGE unleashes the
powerful depth estimation capability of the pre-trained text-to-image model
while preserving its original image generation ability. Compared to other
unified models for image generation and depth estimation, MERGE achieves
state-of- the-art performance across multiple depth estimation benchmarks. The
code will be made available at https://github.com/H-EmbodVis/MERGE

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为“Lookahead Anchoring”的方法，通过利用未来时间步的关键帧作为方向性引导，解决了音频驱动人类动画中身份漂移的问题，同时避免了额外的关键帧生成阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 音频驱动的人类动画模型在时间自回归生成中容易出现身份漂移问题。现有的关键帧生成方法虽然可以防止退化，但需要额外阶段并限制了自然运动动态。

Method: 提出“Lookahead Anchoring”方法，利用未来时间步的关键帧作为方向性引导，使模型在响应即时音频信号的同时保持身份一致性，同时支持自关键帧化。

Result: 该方法在三种最新的人类动画模型上表现出优越的唇同步、身份保持和视觉质量，改善了时间条件的效果。

Conclusion: Lookahead Anchoring通过未来关键帧的方向性引导，显著提升了音频驱动动画的身份一致性和表现力，同时简化了关键帧生成的流程。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation models often suffer from identity drift during
temporal autoregressive generation, where characters gradually lose their
identity over time. One solution is to generate keyframes as intermediate
temporal anchors that prevent degradation, but this requires an additional
keyframe generation stage and can restrict natural motion dynamics. To address
this, we propose Lookahead Anchoring, which leverages keyframes from future
timesteps ahead of the current generation window, rather than within it. This
transforms keyframes from fixed boundaries into directional beacons: the model
continuously pursues these future anchors while responding to immediate audio
cues, maintaining consistent identity through persistent guidance. This also
enables self-keyframing, where the reference image serves as the lookahead
target, eliminating the need for keyframe generation entirely. We find that the
temporal lookahead distance naturally controls the balance between expressivity
and consistency: larger distances allow for greater motion freedom, while
smaller ones strengthen identity adherence. When applied to three recent human
animation models, Lookahead Anchoring achieves superior lip synchronization,
identity preservation, and visual quality, demonstrating improved temporal
conditioning across several different architectures. Video results are

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 直接建模原始数据的显式似然是机器学习领域的关键问题，但在视觉像素数据上连续AR建模面临序列过长和高维空间的挑战。

Method: FARMER通过可逆自回归流将图像转换为隐序列，利用自回归模型隐式建模分布，并提出自监督降维方案和加速推理的一步蒸馏方案。

Result: 实验表明，FARMER在像素级生成模型中表现优异，同时提供精确似然和可扩展的训练。

Conclusion: FARMER统一了NF和AR模型的优势，提高了图像合成的效率和质量。

Abstract: Directly modeling the explicit likelihood of the raw data distribution is key
topic in the machine learning area, which achieves the scaling successes in
Large Language Models by autoregressive modeling. However, continuous AR
modeling over visual pixel data suffer from extremely long sequences and
high-dimensional spaces. In this paper, we present FARMER, a novel end-to-end
generative framework that unifies Normalizing Flows (NF) and Autoregressive
(AR) models for tractable likelihood estimation and high-quality image
synthesis directly from raw pixels. FARMER employs an invertible autoregressive
flow to transform images into latent sequences, whose distribution is modeled
implicitly by an autoregressive model. To address the redundancy and complexity
in pixel-level modeling, we propose a self-supervised dimension reduction
scheme that partitions NF latent channels into informative and redundant
groups, enabling more effective and efficient AR modeling. Furthermore, we
design a one-step distillation scheme to significantly accelerate inference
speed and introduce a resampling-based classifier-free guidance algorithm to
boost image generation quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FARMER
achieves competitive performance compared to existing pixel-based generative
models while providing exact likelihoods and scalable training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数3D算法假设相机内参在视频中保持不变，但实际视频中内参通常会动态变化。目前缺乏动态内参的基准测试，限制了算法的评估和提升。

Method: 作者通过构建一个全面的校准实验查找表，并扩展Kalibr工具箱以提高精度和鲁棒性，创建了InFlux基准测试，包含143K+标注帧和386个高清室内外视频。

Result: InFlux基准测试捕捉了更广泛的内参变化和场景多样性。评估发现，现有方法在动态内参视频上的预测准确性较差。

Conclusion: InFlux填补了动态相机内参基准测试的空白，为未来研究和算法改进提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Accurately tracking camera intrinsics is crucial for achieving 3D
understanding from 2D video. However, most 3D algorithms assume that camera
intrinsics stay constant throughout a video, which is often not true for many
real-world in-the-wild videos. A major obstacle in this field is a lack of
dynamic camera intrinsics benchmarks--existing benchmarks typically offer
limited diversity in scene content and intrinsics variation, and none provide
per-frame intrinsic changes for consecutive video frames. In this paper, we
present Intrinsics in Flux (InFlux), a real-world benchmark that provides
per-frame ground truth intrinsics annotations for videos with dynamic
intrinsics. Compared to prior benchmarks, InFlux captures a wider range of
intrinsic variations and scene diversity, featuring 143K+ annotated frames from
386 high-resolution indoor and outdoor videos with dynamic camera intrinsics.
To ensure accurate per-frame intrinsics, we build a comprehensive lookup table
of calibration experiments and extend the Kalibr toolbox to improve its
accuracy and robustness. Using our benchmark, we evaluate existing baseline
methods for predicting camera intrinsics and find that most struggle to achieve
accurate predictions on videos with dynamic intrinsics. For the dataset, code,

Motivation: 现有MLLM多关注场景级理解，缺乏对象中心的细粒度推理能力，因此提出了PixelRefer框架以满足这一需求。

Method: 提出了Scale-Adaptive Object Tokenizer生成紧凑的语义丰富的对象表示，并通过Object-Centric Infusion模块预融合全局上下文，设计了轻量级的Object-Only Framework。

Result: PixelRefer在少量训练样本下表现优异，而PixelRefer-Lite在保持高语义保真度的同时显著提升了效率。

Conclusion: PixelRefer及PixelRefer-Lite在多模态任务中表现出色，平衡了性能与效率。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
general-purpose capabilities in open-world visual comprehension. However, most
existing MLLMs primarily focus on holistic, scene-level understanding, often
overlooking the need for fine-grained, object-centric reasoning. In this paper,
we present PixelRefer, a unified region-level MLLM framework that enables
advanced fine-grained understanding over user-specified regions across both
images and videos. Motivated by the observation that LLM attention
predominantly focuses on object-level tokens, we propose a Scale-Adaptive
Object Tokenizer (SAOT) to generate compact and semantically rich object
representations from free-form regions. Our analysis reveals that global visual
tokens contribute mainly in early LLM layers, inspiring the design of
PixelRefer-Lite, an efficient variant that employs an Object-Centric Infusion
module to pre-fuse global context into object tokens. This yields a lightweight
Object-Only Framework that substantially reduces computational cost while
maintaining high semantic fidelity. To facilitate fine-grained instruction
tuning, we curate PixelRefer-2.2M, a high-quality object-centric instruction
dataset. Extensive experiments across a range of benchmarks validate that
PixelRefer achieves leading performance with fewer training samples, while
PixelRefer-Lite offers competitive accuracy with notable gains in efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D/4D生成方法在保持语义身份上表现不佳，本研究旨在解决这一问题，提出TIRE方法以实现个性化的3D/4D生成。

Method: TIRE方法通过视频追踪识别需修改区域，使用2D修复模型逐步填充，并重新投影到3D空间以保持一致性。

Result: 实验表明，TIRE方法在3D/4D生成中显著优于现有方法，更好地保留了语义身份。

Conclusion: TIRE为个性化的3D/4D生成提供了一种有效方法，改善了语义身份的保留效果。

Abstract: Current 3D/4D generation methods are usually optimized for photorealism,
efficiency, and aesthetics. However, they often fail to preserve the semantic
identity of the subject across different viewpoints. Adapting generation
methods with one or few images of a specific subject (also known as
Personalization or Subject-driven generation) allows generating visual content
that align with the identity of the subject. However, personalized 3D/4D
generation is still largely underexplored. In this work, we introduce TIRE
(Track, Inpaint, REsplat), a novel method for subject-driven 3D/4D generation.
It takes an initial 3D asset produced by an existing 3D generative model as
input and uses video tracking to identify the regions that need to be modified.
Then, we adopt a subject-driven 2D inpainting model for progressively infilling
the identified regions. Finally, we resplat the modified 2D multi-view
observations back to 3D while still maintaining consistency. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves identity
preservation in 3D/4D generation compared to state-of-the-art methods. Our

Result: 在零样本可视化和线性探测任务中显著优于现有方法，并在多个场景理解基准上达到新SOTA（如ScanNet 80.7% mIoU）。

Conclusion: Concerto生成的表示在几何和语义一致性上表现优异，适用于开放世界感知任务，证明了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Humans learn abstract concepts through multisensory synergy, and once formed,
such representations can often be recalled from a single modality. Inspired by
this principle, we introduce Concerto, a minimalist simulation of human concept
learning for spatial cognition, combining 3D intra-modal self-distillation with
2D-3D cross-modal joint embedding. Despite its simplicity, Concerto learns more
coherent and informative spatial features, as demonstrated by zero-shot
visualizations. It outperforms both standalone SOTA 2D and 3D self-supervised
models by 14.2% and 4.8%, respectively, as well as their feature concatenation,
in linear probing for 3D scene perception. With full fine-tuning, Concerto sets
new SOTA results across multiple scene understanding benchmarks (e.g., 80.7%
mIoU on ScanNet). We further present a variant of Concerto tailored for
video-lifted point cloud spatial understanding, and a translator that linearly
projects Concerto representations into CLIP's language space, enabling
open-world perception. These results highlight that Concerto emerges spatial
representations with superior fine-grained geometric and semantic consistency.

Abstract: Policy optimization (PO) algorithms are used to refine Large Language Models
for complex, multi-step reasoning. Current state-of-the-art pipelines enforce a
strict think-then-answer format to elicit chain-of-thought (CoT); however, the
behavior of PO when these rigid constraints are relaxed into an open-ended CoT
structure remains an under-studied question. We investigate this gap with an
extensive suite of controlled experiments and identify a consistent principle:
\textit{policy optimization consistently follows the path of least resistance}.
When afforded the flexibility to interleave reasoning and response, policy
optimization consistently learns to discard explicit reasoning, causing the
policy to degenerate to a direct \texttt{<answer>}-only format. This outcome
holds true across various models and algorithms. We find that this collapse in
format is persistent even when the complex \texttt{<think><answer>} format is
assigned up to 4x larger reward weights. We formalize this principle through a
series of controlled reward decomposition experiments, demonstrating a clear
hierarchy: PO systematically optimizes for the simplest reward component first,
a preference that holds even when faced with mutually exclusive choices or
strong incentives for more complex behaviors. Finally, we show that successful
convergence on the high-reward shortcut is not a low-effort drift but is driven
by the optimization process that requires the KL-regularized policy to have
sufficient freedom to make a significant shift from its initial prior. Our
findings reveal that granting policies the freedom to diverge is a double-edged
sword: while necessary for discovering high-reward shortcuts, it also creates a
powerful incentive to game the simplest aspects of the reward function, posing
a critical challenge for reward hacking under alignment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM研究主要关注输出分布的优化，而忽视了解码过程的重要性。现有的解码方法计算成本高且适用性有限，存在冗余问题。

Method: 借鉴推荐系统的思路，将解码过程视为排序阶段，并提出Language Ranker框架，通过轻量级模块对候选响应重新排序。

Result: 实验显示，Language Ranker在多种任务中表现优异，仅需增加<0.5M参数，显著降低训练和推理的计算开销。

Conclusion: 该方法高效且有效，能够充分发挥LLM的潜力。

Abstract: Conventional research on large language models (LLMs) has primarily focused
on refining output distributions, while paying less attention to the decoding
process that transforms these distributions into final responses. Recent
advances, such as scaling the computation of inference time with reward models,
have underscored the importance of decoding, but these methods often suffer
from high computational costs and limited applicability. In this paper, we
revisit LLM generation through the lens of recommender systems, conceptualizing
the decoding process as analogous to the ranking stage in recommendation
pipelines. From this perspective, we observe that both traditional decoding
methods and reward models exhibit clear limitations such as redundancy.
Motivated by this insight, we propose Language Ranker, a novel framework that
introduces a lightweight module to rerank candidate responses using features
extracted by the base model. Experiments across a wide range of tasks show that
Language Ranker achieves performance comparable to large-scale reward models,
while requiring only <0.5M additional parameters, significantly reducing the
computational overhead during both training and inference stages. This
highlights the efficiency and effectiveness of our method, showcasing its

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于行为感知的采样框架，通过选择指令响应行为和语义多样性来改进大型语言模型的安全微调，显著减少有害输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在良性数据微调时会遗忘安全对齐行为（灾难性遗忘），现有方法通过随机添加安全示例缓解，但未明确哪些示例最有效。

Method: 提出了一个行为感知采样框架，基于指令响应行为（如拒绝与服从）和跨伤害类别的语义多样性来选择安全示例。

Result: 该方法在仅增加0.5%训练数据的情况下，将有害输出减少了41%，同时保持了模型的帮助性。

Conclusion: 有针对性的数据选择能显著提高大规模微调的安全性和效率。

Abstract: Large language models often lose previously aligned safety behaviors when
fine-tuned on benign data, a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Prior
work shows that adding random safety examples can mitigate this effect, but it
remains unclear which examples are most effective. We propose a behavior-aware
sampling framework that selects safety examples based on two complementary
factors: instruction-response behavior (e.g., refusal versus compliance) and
semantic diversity across harm categories. Systematic evaluation shows that
this approach substantially reduces harmful outputs while maintaining
helpfulness, achieving up to a 41% reduction in harmfulness with only 0.5%
additional training data. These results highlight how targeted data selection
can improve the safety and efficiency of fine-tuning at scale.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出一种名为语义各向同性（semantic isotropy）的方法，通过评估文本嵌入在单位球面上的均匀性来判断大语言模型生成的长格式回答的可信度，无需标记数据或调优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大语言模型应用于高风险领域时，需要可靠且低成本的方法评估其长格式回答的可信度，现有的逐项事实核查方法成本高且不实用。

Method: 通过生成多个长格式回答并嵌入单位球面，计算嵌入的角分散度（语义各向同性）来评估回答的可信度。

Result: 研究发现更高的语义各向同性（嵌入更分散）与更低的事实一致性相关，该方法在多个领域表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 语义各向同性为评估大语言模型生成回答的可信度提供了一种无需标记数据、低成本且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: To deploy large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes application domains
that require substantively accurate responses to open-ended prompts, we need
reliable, computationally inexpensive methods that assess the trustworthiness
of long-form responses generated by LLMs. However, existing approaches often
rely on claim-by-claim fact-checking, which is computationally expensive and
brittle in long-form responses to open-ended prompts. In this work, we
introduce semantic isotropy -- the degree of uniformity across normalized text
embeddings on the unit sphere -- and use it to assess the trustworthiness of
long-form responses generated by LLMs. To do so, we generate several long-form
responses, embed them, and estimate the level of semantic isotropy of these
responses as the angular dispersion of the embeddings on the unit sphere. We
find that higher semantic isotropy -- that is, greater embedding dispersion --
reliably signals lower factual consistency across samples. Our approach
requires no labeled data, no fine-tuning, and no hyperparameter selection, and
can be used with open- or closed-weight embedding models. Across multiple
domains, our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in predicting
nonfactuality in long-form responses using only a handful of samples --
offering a practical, low-cost approach for integrating trust assessment into
real-world LLM workflows.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多语言并行文本编码时的令牌差异（令牌溢价），发现即使控制了数据集大小、词汇量和数据内容，单语令牌器在不同语言间仍表现出显著的令牌溢价差异。通过训练大量单语令牌器并分析影响因素，研究发现词汇量和预令牌化是关键因素，且可以通过调整它们来显著减少令牌溢价效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多语言令牌溢价的成因及其影响因素，旨在减少训练和推理过程中的开销。

Method: 训练了约7,000个单语令牌器，涵盖97种语言，通过操纵令牌化算法、词汇量和数据集大小来测量令牌溢价，并分析数据相似性、词汇量、预令牌化及语言特定特征（如书写系统和词长）的关系。

Result: 相似性对令牌溢价无显著影响，但词汇量和预令牌化是关键因素；通过优化词汇量和采用超级词令牌器，可显著减少令牌溢价效应。

Conclusion: 通过干预词汇量和预令牌化，能够显著减少跨语言令牌溢价效应，提升整体压缩效率。

Abstract: The number of tokens it takes to encode parallel text in different languages
is known to vary. These disparities are called token premiums. Having high
token premiums leads to less throughput during training and increases costs at
inference. In this paper, we show that even after controlling for dataset size,
vocabulary size, and data content, monolingual tokenizers exhibit a wide range
of token premiums across languages. To understand the cross-linguistic
differences that cause these token premiums, we train a suite of approximately
7,000 comparable monolingual tokenizers for 97 languages, manipulating
tokenization algorithm, vocabulary size, and dataset size. We measure token
premiums and test for a relationship between factors such as data similarity
(between tokenizer training and evaluation), vocabulary size, and
pre-tokenization. We also investigate the role of language-specific features
such as writing system and word length. We find that similarity between
training and test data does not impact token premiums, but vocabulary size and
pre-tokenization do. While simply increasing vocabulary size does not lead to
reduced token premium effects, we can determine an ``optimal'' vocabulary size
for each language to achieve significantly reduced token premium effects. We
also train superword tokenizers which allow merges over whitespaces, and we
find that they both reduce token premium effects and improve compression
overall. Thus, intervening on the vocabulary size or the pre-tokenizer
significantly reduces crosslingual token premium effects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多语言LLMs中预定义Tokenizer对低资源或不同脚本语言适应性的瓶颈问题。

Method: 通过Attention Influence Modeling目标，将源模型的令牌间通信模式蒸馏到目标模型，并结合标准语言建模进行优化。

Result: 在多样语言环境中，MATT在短时间内恢复了模型大部分性能，优于现有启发式方法。

Conclusion: 模型级信号的引入为多语言LLMs中Tokenizer迁移提供了高效且实用的路径。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are trained to support an increasing number of
languages, yet their predefined tokenizers remain a bottleneck for adapting
models to lower-resource or distinct-script languages. Existing tokenizer
transfer methods typically rely on semantic heuristics to initialize new
embeddings, ignoring higher-layer model dynamics and limiting transfer quality.
We propose Model-Aware Tokenizer Transfer (MATT), a method that incorporates
model internals into the tokenizer transfer process. MATT introduces an
Attention Influence Modeling (AIM) objective that distills inter-token
communication patterns from a source model into a target model with a new
tokenizer, providing an efficient warm-up before standard language modeling.
Unlike approaches that focus solely on embedding similarity, MATT leverages
attention behavior to guide embedding initialization and adaptation.
Experiments across diverse linguistic settings show that MATT recovers a large
fraction of the original model's performance within a few GPU hours,
outperforming heuristic baselines. These results demonstrate that incorporating
model-level signals offers a practical and effective path toward robust
tokenizer transfer in multilingual LLMs.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型是否能捕捉和区分不同作者的独特写作风格，并为争议作品的作者归属问题提供解决方案。

Method: 使用GPT-2模型，针对每位作者的单独训练集从头训练，并通过预测测试文本来验证模型对特定作者风格的掌握程度。

Result: 实验证明，模型能更准确地预测训练作者的文本，并用此方法确认了R. P. Thompson对争议作品的实际作者身份。

Conclusion: 大型语言模型能够有效学习和区分作者的写作风格，并为文学研究中的作者身份鉴定提供新工具。

Abstract: We show that large language models (LLMs) can be used to distinguish the
writings of different authors. Specifically, an individual GPT-2 model, trained
from scratch on the works of one author, will predict held-out text from that
author more accurately than held-out text from other authors. We suggest that,
in this way, a model trained on one author's works embodies the unique writing
style of that author. We first demonstrate our approach on books written by
eight different (known) authors. We also use this approach to confirm R. P.
Thompson's authorship of the well-studied 15th book of the Oz series,
originally attributed to F. L. Baum.

Conclusion: 跨学科视角对解决LLM安全问题至关重要。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, Large Language Models remain vulnerable to jailbreak
attacks that bypass alignment safeguards and elicit harmful outputs. While
prior research has proposed various attack strategies differing in human
readability and transferability, little attention has been paid to the
linguistic and psychological mechanisms that may influence a model's
susceptibility to such attacks. In this paper, we examine an interdisciplinary
line of research that leverages foundational theories of persuasion from the
social sciences to craft adversarial prompts capable of circumventing alignment
constraints in LLMs. Drawing on well-established persuasive strategies, we
hypothesize that LLMs, having been trained on large-scale human-generated text,
may respond more compliantly to prompts with persuasive structures.
Furthermore, we investigate whether LLMs themselves exhibit distinct persuasive
fingerprints that emerge in their jailbreak responses. Empirical evaluations
across multiple aligned LLMs reveal that persuasion-aware prompts significantly
bypass safeguards, demonstrating their potential to induce jailbreak behaviors.
This work underscores the importance of cross-disciplinary insight in
addressing the evolving challenges of LLM safety. The code and data are
available.

Method: 通过识别三种统计特性（提示激活模型内部拒绝方向的程度、后缀诱导的远离拒绝方向的强度、正交方向的移动大小）来分析转移成功的原因。

Result: 发现提示语义相似性与转移成功的相关性较弱，而三种统计特性与转移成功高度相关。

Conclusion: 研究提供了对攻击后缀可转移性的更细致理解，并通过干预实验展示了统计分析的实用性。

Abstract: Discrete optimization-based jailbreaking attacks on large language models aim
to generate short, nonsensical suffixes that, when appended onto input prompts,
elicit disallowed content. Notably, these suffixes are often transferable --
succeeding on prompts and models for which they were never optimized. And yet,
despite the fact that transferability is surprising and empirically
well-established, the field lacks a rigorous analysis of when and why transfer
occurs. To fill this gap, we identify three statistical properties that
strongly correlate with transfer success across numerous experimental settings:
(1) how much a prompt without a suffix activates a model's internal refusal
direction, (2) how strongly a suffix induces a push away from this direction,
and (3) how large these shifts are in directions orthogonal to refusal. On the
other hand, we find that prompt semantic similarity only weakly correlates with
transfer success. These findings lead to a more fine-grained understanding of
transferability, which we use in interventional experiments to showcase how our
statistical analysis can translate into practical improvements in attack
success.

Result: 发现QE指标存在两种长度偏差，提出的策略能有效减少这些偏差。

Conclusion: 长度偏差显著影响QE指标的公平性，提出的方法能够改善这一问题。

Abstract: Quality Estimation (QE) metrics are vital in machine translation for
reference-free evaluation and as a reward signal in tasks like reinforcement
learning. However, the prevalence and impact of length bias in QE have been
underexplored. Through a systematic study of top-performing regression-based
and LLM-as-a-Judge QE metrics across 10 diverse language pairs, we reveal two
critical length biases: First, QE metrics consistently over-predict errors with
increasing translation length, even for high-quality, error-free texts. Second,
they exhibit a preference for shorter translations when multiple candidates are
available for the same source text. These inherent length biases risk unfairly
penalizing longer, correct translations and can lead to sub-optimal
decision-making in applications such as QE reranking and QE guided
reinforcement learning. To mitigate this, we propose two strategies: (a)
applying length normalization during model training, and (b) incorporating
reference texts during evaluation. Both approaches were found to effectively
reduce the identified length bias.

Abstract: Scaling laws research has focused overwhelmingly on English -- yet the most
prominent AI models explicitly serve billions of international users. In this
work, we undertake the largest multilingual scaling laws study to date,
totaling 774 multilingual training experiments, spanning 10M-8B model
parameters, 400+ training languages and 48 evaluation languages. We introduce
the Adaptive Transfer Scaling Law (ATLAS) for both monolingual and multilingual
pretraining, which outperforms existing scaling laws' out-of-sample
generalization often by more than 0.3 R^2. Our analyses of the experiments shed
light on multilingual learning dynamics, transfer properties between languages,
and the curse of multilinguality. First, we derive a cross-lingual transfer
matrix, empirically measuring mutual benefit scores between 38 x 38=1444
language pairs. Second, we derive a language-agnostic scaling law that reveals
how to optimally scale model size and data when adding languages without
sacrificing performance. Third, we identify the computational crossover points
for when to pretrain from scratch versus finetune from multilingual
checkpoints. We hope these findings provide the scientific foundation for
democratizing scaling laws across languages, and enable practitioners to
efficiently scale models -- beyond English-first AI.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: This work investigates how large language models (LLMs) internally represent
emotion by analyzing the geometry of their hidden-state space. The paper
identifies a low-dimensional emotional manifold and shows that emotional
representations are directionally encoded, distributed across layers, and
aligned with interpretable dimensions. These structures are stable across depth
and generalize to eight real-world emotion datasets spanning five languages.
Cross-domain alignment yields low error and strong linear probe performance,
indicating a universal emotional subspace. Within this space, internal emotion
perception can be steered while preserving semantics using a learned
intervention module, with especially strong control for basic emotions across
languages. These findings reveal a consistent and manipulable affective
geometry in LLMs and offer insight into how they internalize and process
emotion.

Conclusion: 仅显式监督能有效减少组合偏见，偏好学习方法无法泛化逻辑结构，凸显其局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) still produce gender-stereotyped language even
in occupation-neutral contexts that reflect deep societal biases (Rudinger et
al., 2018). To address this, prior work has proposed prompting, constrained
decoding (Dathathri et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2024), post-processing, and
fine-tuning-based alignment (Rafailov et al., 2023; Ravfogel et al., 2022).
However, the comparative efficacy and learning dynamics remain little
understood. We report a comparative analysis of six control techniques for bias
mitigation: prompt-only, generate-and-filter, DFA-based Ctrl-G decoding,
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and
Iterative Nullspace Projection (INLP). We evaluate each method on a
compositional constraint task. This task requires generating sentences that
contain at least one agentic and one communal descriptor for each of the twenty
Winogender-derived occupations. We quantify trade-offs between control strength
and naturalness with evaluations of constraint compliance, lexical diversity,
and fluency. Our results reveal key contrasts among the methods: SFT achieves
99.87 +- 0.15% compliance and high lexical diversity, while DPO, despite
similar training stability, fails at 4.53 +- 0.82%. Ctrl-G guarantees perfect
compliance, but at the cost of severely reduced fluency and diversity.
Preference-based learning fundamentally differs: it cannot satisfy
compositional constraints, as binary preference signals encode ranking, not
logical conjunctions. Only explicit positive supervision enables mitigation of
compositional biases; preference-based alignment fails to generalize logical
structures, underscoring the limitations of preference learning and the
necessity of explicit supervision for fair and fluent controlled generation.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit a troubling duality, capable of both
remarkable generalization and brittle, verbatim memorization of their training
data. This unpredictability undermines their reliability in high-stakes
applications. In this work, we propose a unified framework to understand,
identify, and control these distinct reasoning modes. First, we introduce a
theoretical model based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle,
formalizing generalization as the learning of a compressed, task-relevant
representation and memorization as a failure to compress. Building on this
theory, we develop Dynamic Mode Steering (DMS), a novel inference-time
algorithm which comprises two components: (1) a lightweight, causally-grounded
linear probe that identifies the model's instantaneous reliance on
memorization, and (2) a dynamic activation steering mechanism that nudges the
model's computation towards pre-identified generalization circuits. We frame
DMS as a form of adaptive, self-contrastive decoding. Experiments on reasoning
and faithfulness tasks demonstrate that DMS significantly improves logical
consistency and factual accuracy, thereby offering a principled approach to
enhancing LLM reliability.

Motivation: 现有方法通过增加架构复杂性（如递归或辅助记忆模块）处理长上下文，本文旨在通过简单的输入表示压缩来解决问题。

Method: 提出了一种对数压缩输入表示的方法，保持Transformer架构不变，仅对输入进行处理。

Result: 在WikiText-103和PG-19基准测试中，模型的困惑度降低，且随着压缩上下文的增加性能持续提升。

Conclusion: 输入级的对数压缩是一种简单有效的方法，可扩展Transformer的长范围记忆能力。

Abstract: Most approaches to long-context processing increase the complexity of the
transformer's internal architecture by integrating mechanisms such as
recurrence or auxiliary memory modules. In this work, we introduce an
alternative approach that modifies the input representation itself, rather than
the transformer architecture. Inspired by cognitive models of human memory, our
method applies a scale-invariant logarithmic compression to the input tokens.
The resulting compressed representation is processed by a standard, unmodified
transformer, preserving architectural simplicity. We evaluate this approach on
the WikiText-103 and PG-19 language modeling benchmarks, showing a reduction in
perplexity compared to uncompressed baselines. Moreover, performance improves
consistently with longer compressed temporal contexts, showing that input-level
logarithmic compression is a simple and effective way to extend a transformer's
long-range memory.

Abstract: We introduce Ling 2.0, a series reasoning-oriented language foundation built
upon the principle that every activation boosts reasoning capability. Designed
to scale from tens of billions to one trillion parameters under a unified
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) paradigm, Ling 2.0 emphasizes high sparsity,
cross-scale consistency, and efficiency guided by empirical scaling laws. The
series includes three non-thinking (instruct) models - Ling-mini-2.0,
Ling-flash-2.0, and Ling-1T - ranging from 16B to 1T total parameters and
achieving up to 7-fold active-compute efficiency compared with dense
counterparts. Ling 2.0 integrates coordinated innovations across model
architecture, pre-training, post-training, and infrastructure: a high-sparsity
MoE with MTP for efficient reasoning, reasoning-oriented data and mid-training
CoT activation, reinforcement-based fine-tuning (DFT, Evo-CoT), and full-scale
FP8 training with fine-grained heterogeneous pipelines. At the trillion scale,
Ling-1T establishes a new Pareto frontier of reasoning accuracy versus
computational efficiency, demonstrating that sparse activation, when properly
aligned with reasoning objectives, enables scalable and efficient intelligence.
Collectively, Ling 2.0 provides a coherent, open, and efficient foundation for
advancing future reasoning and thinking models, including the Ring series built

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Maithili作为一种低资源语言，在自然语言处理研究中代表性不足，缺乏细粒度标注和可解释性机制的数据集。

Method: 引入了一个新数据集，包含情感极性和自然语言解释，并由语言学专家验证。通过经典机器学习和先进Transformer架构进行实验。

Result: 数据集为Maithili的可解释情感分析提供了首个基准，提升了模型的可解释性和文化适应性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为多语言NLP和可解释AI的发展提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Developing benchmark datasets for low-resource languages poses significant
challenges, primarily due to the limited availability of native linguistic
experts and the substantial time and cost involved in annotation. Given these
challenges, Maithili is still underrepresented in natural language processing
research. It is an Indo-Aryan language spoken by more than 13 million people in
the Purvanchal region of India, valued for its rich linguistic structure and
cultural significance. While sentiment analysis has achieved remarkable
progress in high-resource languages, resources for low-resource languages, such
as Maithili, remain scarce, often restricted to coarse-grained annotations and
lacking interpretability mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce a
novel dataset comprising 3,221 Maithili sentences annotated for sentiment
polarity and accompanied by natural language justifications. Moreover, the
dataset is carefully curated and validated by linguistic experts to ensure both
label reliability and contextual fidelity. Notably, the justifications are
written in Maithili, thereby promoting culturally grounded interpretation and
enhancing the explainability of sentiment models. Furthermore, extensive
experiments using both classical machine learning and state-of-the-art
transformer architectures demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness for

### [191] [DETECT: Determining Ease and Textual Clarity of German Text Simplifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22212)
*Maria Korobeynikova,Alessia Battisti,Lukas Fischer,Yingqiang Gao*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文介绍了DETECT，首个德语专用的自动文本简化（ATS）评估指标，涵盖简洁性、意义保留和流畅性，并通过合成数据集训练，优于传统指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 德语ATS评估依赖通用指标（如SARI、BLEU等），无法全面衡量简化质量，需要专门针对德语开发的指标。

Method: 基于LENS框架，结合LLM生成合成质量分数和数据集，并通过LLM优化评分标准。

Result: DETECT在人类评估数据上表现优于通用ATS指标，尤其在意义保留和流畅性方面。

Conclusion: DETECT填补了德语ATS评估空白，展示了LLM在自动评估中的潜力与限制。

Abstract: Current evaluation of German automatic text simplification (ATS) relies on
general-purpose metrics such as SARI, BLEU, and BERTScore, which insufficiently
capture simplification quality in terms of simplicity, meaning preservation,
and fluency. While specialized metrics like LENS have been developed for
English, corresponding efforts for German have lagged behind due to the absence
of human-annotated corpora. To close this gap, we introduce DETECT, the first
German-specific metric that holistically evaluates ATS quality across all three
dimensions of simplicity, meaning preservation, and fluency, and is trained
entirely on synthetic large language model (LLM) responses. Our approach adapts
the LENS framework to German and extends it with (i) a pipeline for generating
synthetic quality scores via LLMs, enabling dataset creation without human
annotation, and (ii) an LLM-based refinement step for aligning grading criteria
with simplification requirements. To the best of our knowledge, we also
construct the largest German human evaluation dataset for text simplification
to validate our metric directly. Experimental results show that DETECT achieves
substantially higher correlations with human judgments than widely used ATS
metrics, with particularly strong gains in meaning preservation and fluency.
Beyond ATS, our findings highlight both the potential and the limitations of
LLMs for automatic evaluation and provide transferable guidelines for general
language accessibility tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: We measure LLMs' output error at pairwise text comparison, noting the
probability of error in their preferences. Our method does not rely on the
ground truth and supports two scenarios: (i) uniform error rate regardless of
the order of comparison, estimated with two comparisons for each text pair with
either text placed first; (ii) binary positional bias assuming distinct error
rates for the two orders of comparison, estimated with repeated comparisons
between the texts. The Copeland counting constructs a ranking over the compared
texts from pairwise preferences; the ranking reveals the poor scalability of
LLM-based pairwise comparison and helps yield the estimates for LLMs' error
rates. We apply the method to six LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini,
Grok, Qwen) with five types of text input and obtain consistent estimates of
LLMs' error. In general, the measured two positional bias terms are similar,
close to the uniform error. Considering both the error rates and the robustness
to the variation of prompts, Claude obtained the most desirable performance in
this experiment. Our model outperforms the biased Bradley-Terry model and the
commutativity score in indicating LLMs' error at this task.

*Maurizio Serva*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文分析了Swadesh方法在语言时间分离估计中的局限性，指出其基本假设的不足及其结果的不准确性，同时提出了另一种词汇演变过程——词汇渐进修改，证明其能显著提高时间分离的估计精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Swadesh方法常用于语言时间分离估计，但其假设往往不切实际，导致结果不准确。本文旨在揭示其局限性，并提出一种新的词汇演变模型以提高准确性。

Method: 通过数学分析揭示Swadesh方法的概率限制，并引入词汇渐进修改的随机过程，结合概率方法验证其对时间分离估计的影响。

Result: 研究发现，传统的Swadesh方法存在固有的不确定性，而词汇渐进修改过程能显著提升时间分离的估计精度。

Conclusion: 词汇渐进修改与词汇替换一样是语言演变的重要动力，综合考虑二者能更精确地估计语言的时间分离。

Abstract: The Swadesh approach for determining the temporal separation between two
languages relies on the stochastic process of words replacement (when a
complete new word emerges to represent a given concept). It is well known that
the basic assumptions of the Swadesh approach are often unrealistic due to
various contamination phenomena and misjudgments (horizontal transfers,
variations over time and space of the replacement rate, incorrect assessments
of cognacy relationships, presence of synonyms, and so on). All of this means
that the results cannot be completely correct.
  More importantly, even in the unrealistic case that all basic assumptions are
satisfied, simple mathematics places limits on the accuracy of estimating the
temporal separation between two languages. These limits, which are purely
probabilistic in nature and which are often neglected in lexicostatistical
studies, are analyzed in detail in this article.
  Furthermore, in this work we highlight that the evolution of a language's
lexicon is also driven by another stochastic process: gradual lexical
modification of words. We show that this process equally also represents a
major contribution to the reshaping of the vocabulary of languages over the
centuries and we also show, from a purely probabilistic perspective, that
taking into account this second random process significantly increases the
precision in determining the temporal separation between two languages.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: SteerX是一种基于因果推断的解耦激活引导方法，通过识别偏好驱动的信息提升LLM个性化效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导方法依赖所有历史数据计算引导向量，忽略了并非所有内容都反映真实用户偏好的问题，从而降低了个性化信号的质量。

Method: SteerX是一种解耦引导方法，基于因果推断理论识别偏好驱动的标记（token），并将这些离散信号转换为连贯的描述，用于引导个性化LLM生成。

Result: 实验表明，SteerX在真实数据集上提升了引导向量的质量，增强了LLM的个性化效果。

Conclusion: SteerX通过专注于偏好驱动的信息，为LLM个性化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success in recent years,
enabling a wide range of applications, including intelligent assistants that
support users' daily life and work. A critical factor in building such
assistants is personalizing LLMs, as user preferences and needs vary widely.
Activation steering, which directly leverages directions representing user
preference in the LLM activation space to adjust its behavior, offers a
cost-effective way to align the model's outputs with individual users. However,
existing methods rely on all historical data to compute the steering vector,
ignoring that not all content reflects true user preferences, which undermines
the personalization signal. To address this, we propose SteerX, a disentangled
steering method that isolates preference-driven components from
preference-agnostic components. Grounded in causal inference theory, SteerX
estimates token-level causal effects to identify preference-driven tokens,
transforms these discrete signals into a coherent description, and then
leverages them to steer personalized LLM generation. By focusing on the truly
preference-driven information, SteerX produces more accurate activation
steering vectors and enhances personalization. Experiments on two
representative steering backbone methods across real-world datasets demonstrate
that SteerX consistently enhances steering vector quality, offering a practical
solution for more effective LLM personalization.

Motivation: 现有基准测试未能充分捕捉专利特定的挑战，因此需要一个更全面的基准测试来支持专利检索、分类等技术任务。

Method: 开发了PatenTEB基准测试，包含15个任务和206万个示例，并使用多任务训练开发了patembed模型家族。

Result: patembed-base在MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2上达到最先进水平，patembed-large在DAPFAM上也表现优异。多任务训练和领域预训练初始化提供了显著优势。

Conclusion: PatenTEB为专利文本嵌入提供了全面的评估框架，patembed模型家族在多项任务中表现出色，相关资源将公开。

Abstract: Patent text embeddings enable prior art search, technology landscaping, and
patent analysis, yet existing benchmarks inadequately capture patent-specific
challenges. We introduce PatenTEB, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 15
tasks across retrieval, classification, paraphrase, and clustering, with 2.06
million examples. PatenTEB employs domain-stratified splits, domain specific
hard negative mining, and systematic coverage of asymmetric
fragment-to-document matching scenarios absent from general embedding
benchmarks. We develop the patembed model family through multi-task training,
spanning 67M to 344M parameters with context lengths up to 4096 tokens.
External validation shows strong generalization: patembed-base achieves
state-of-the-art on MTEB BigPatentClustering.v2 (0.494 V-measure vs. 0.445
previous best), while patembed-large achieves 0.377 NDCG@100 on DAPFAM.
Systematic ablations reveal that multi-task training improves external
generalization despite minor benchmark costs, and that domain-pretrained
initialization provides consistent advantages across task families. All

Motivation: LLM在教育场景中的应用存在准确性不足的问题，尤其是在大学级别课程中。研究旨在探索如何通过课程材料提升LLM的表现。

Method: 比较了两种策略：检索增强生成（RAG）和持续预训练（CPT）。对于幻灯片材料，还探索了多模态RAG方法，将检索内容以图像形式呈现。

Result: 实验表明，RAG比CPT更有效且高效；多模态设置中，以图像形式整合幻灯片显著优于仅文本检索。

Conclusion: 研究为开发支持教学的AI助手提供了实用策略，并鼓励在教育领域进行类似尝试。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years. One
application of LLMs is to support student learning in educational settings.
However, prior work has shown that LLMs still struggle to answer questions
accurately within university-level computer science courses. In this work, we
investigate how incorporating university course materials can enhance LLM
performance in this setting. A key challenge lies in leveraging diverse course
materials such as lecture slides and transcripts, which differ substantially
from typical textual corpora: slides also contain visual elements like images
and formulas, while transcripts contain spoken, less structured language. We
compare two strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Continual
Pre-Training (CPT), to extend LLMs with course-specific knowledge. For lecture
slides, we further explore a multi-modal RAG approach, where we present the
retrieved content to the generator in image form. Our experiments reveal that,
given the relatively small size of university course materials, RAG is more
effective and efficient than CPT. Moreover, incorporating slides as images in
the multi-modal setting significantly improves performance over text-only
retrieval. These findings highlight practical strategies for developing AI
assistants that better support learning and teaching, and we hope they inspire
similar efforts in other educational contexts.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文研究了临床命名实体识别（NER），比较了BERT类编码器、GPT-4o的小样本上下文学习（ICL）及监督微调（SFT）三种方法，发现SFT表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨不同方法在临床NER任务上的表现，特别是大规模语言模型（LLM）的潜力。

Method: 比较BERT类模型（BERT Base、BioClinicalBERT、RoBERTa-large）、GPT-4o的小样本ICL（简单与复杂提示）和监督微调（SFT）。

Result: RoBERTa-large和BioClinicalBERT对BERT Base提升有限；简单ICL优于复杂提示；SFT表现最佳（F1≈87.1%）。LLM在简化任务（双标签分类）中更准确。

Conclusion: SFT是临床NER任务中最有效的方法，但成本较高；LLM在简化任务中表现更优。

Abstract: We study clinical Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the CADEC corpus and
compare three families of approaches: (i) BERT-style encoders (BERT Base,
BioClinicalBERT, RoBERTa-large), (ii) GPT-4o used with few-shot in-context
learning (ICL) under simple vs.\ complex prompts, and (iii) GPT-4o with
supervised fine-tuning (SFT). All models are evaluated on standard NER metrics
over CADEC's five entity types (ADR, Drug, Disease, Symptom, Finding).
RoBERTa-large and BioClinicalBERT offer limited improvements over BERT Base,
showing the limit of these family of models. Among LLM settings, simple ICL
outperforms a longer, instruction-heavy prompt, and SFT achieves the strongest
overall performance (F1 $\approx$ 87.1%), albeit with higher cost. We find that
the LLM achieve higher accuracy on simplified tasks, restricting classification
to two labels.

Motivation: 填补多语言TSE任务的空白，评估多语言环境下的TSE性能。

Result: 模型在多语言任务中F1分数为12.78，表明目标预测是主要瓶颈。

Conclusion: 研究为多语言TSE提供了资源和评估基准，并揭示了任务难点。

Abstract: Social media enables data-driven analysis of public opinion on contested
issues. Target-Stance Extraction (TSE) is the task of identifying the target
discussed in a document and the document's stance towards that target. Many
works classify stance towards a given target in a multilingual setting, but all
prior work in TSE is English-only. This work introduces the first multilingual
TSE benchmark, spanning Catalan, Estonian, French, Italian, Mandarin, and
Spanish corpora. It manages to extend the original TSE pipeline to a
multilingual setting without requiring separate models for each language. Our
model pipeline achieves a modest F1 score of 12.78, underscoring the increased
difficulty of the multilingual task relative to English-only setups and
highlighting target prediction as the primary bottleneck. We are also the first
to demonstrate the sensitivity of TSE's F1 score to different target
verbalizations. Together these serve as a much-needed baseline for resources,
algorithms, and evaluation criteria in multilingual TSE.

Abstract: Ironic identification is a challenging task in Natural Language Processing,
particularly when dealing with languages that differ in syntax and cultural
context. In this work, we aim to detect irony in Urdu by translating an English
Ironic Corpus into the Urdu language. We evaluate ten state-of-the-art machine
learning algorithms using GloVe and Word2Vec embeddings, and compare their
performance with classical methods. Additionally, we fine-tune advanced
transformer-based models, including BERT, RoBERTa, LLaMA 2 (7B), LLaMA 3 (8B),
and Mistral, to assess the effectiveness of large-scale models in irony
detection. Among machine learning models, Gradient Boosting achieved the best
performance with an F1-score of 89.18%. Among transformer-based models, LLaMA 3
(8B) achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 94.61%. These results
demonstrate that combining transliteration techniques with modern NLP models
enables robust irony detection in Urdu, a historically low-resource language.

addresses key limitations of existing methods by unifying diverse objectives
and leveraging synthetic data generation. Architectural innovations include
bidirectional attention for contextual modeling, latent attention pooling for
robust sequence aggregation, and strategic pruning of 25% of transformer layers
to enhance efficiency without compromising performance. Evaluated on the ruMTEB

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可视化质量评估需兼顾数据准确性、信息表达和美观性，但目前缺乏系统性基准来衡量多模态大语言模型在此任务上的能力。

Method: 构建VisJudge-Bench基准，包含3,090个专家标注的真实场景样本，覆盖32种图表类型，并通过系统性测试评估模型表现。

Result: 现有最先进模型（如GPT-5）与人类专家相比仍有显著差距（MAE=0.551，相关性0.429），而VisJudge模型将MAE降低19.8%，一致性提高58.7%。

Conclusion: VisJudge模型在可视化质量评估任务上显著优于现有大语言模型，VisJudge-Bench基准为未来研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Visualization, a domain-specific yet widely used form of imagery, is an
effective way to turn complex datasets into intuitive insights, and its value
depends on whether data are faithfully represented, clearly communicated, and
aesthetically designed. However, evaluating visualization quality is
challenging: unlike natural images, it requires simultaneous judgment across
data encoding accuracy, information expressiveness, and visual aesthetics.
Although multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown promising
performance in aesthetic assessment of natural images, no systematic benchmark
exists for measuring their capabilities in evaluating visualizations. To
address this, we propose VisJudge-Bench, the first comprehensive benchmark for
evaluating MLLMs' performance in assessing visualization aesthetics and
quality. It contains 3,090 expert-annotated samples from real-world scenarios,
covering single visualizations, multiple visualizations, and dashboards across
32 chart types. Systematic testing on this benchmark reveals that even the most
advanced MLLMs (such as GPT-5) still exhibit significant gaps compared to human
experts in judgment, with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.551 and a
correlation with human ratings of only 0.429. To address this issue, we propose
VisJudge, a model specifically designed for visualization aesthetics and
quality assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that VisJudge
significantly narrows the gap with human judgment, reducing the MAE to 0.442 (a
19.8% reduction) and increasing the consistency with human experts to 0.681 (a
58.7% improvement) compared to GPT-5. The benchmark is available at

Abstract: We introduce the CAP (Confabulations from ACL Publications) dataset, a
multilingual resource for studying hallucinations in large language models
(LLMs) within scientific text generation. CAP focuses on the scientific domain,
where hallucinations can distort factual knowledge, as they frequently do. In
this domain, however, the presence of specialized terminology, statistical
reasoning, and context-dependent interpretations further exacerbates these
distortions, particularly given LLMs' lack of true comprehension, limited
contextual understanding, and bias toward surface-level generalization. CAP
operates in a cross-lingual setting covering five high-resource languages
(English, French, Hindi, Italian, and Spanish) and four low-resource languages
(Bengali, Gujarati, Malayalam, and Telugu). The dataset comprises 900 curated
scientific questions and over 7000 LLM-generated answers from 16 publicly
available models, provided as question-answer pairs along with token sequences
and corresponding logits. Each instance is annotated with a binary label
indicating the presence of a scientific hallucination, denoted as a factuality
error, and a fluency label, capturing issues in the linguistic quality or
naturalness of the text. CAP is publicly released to facilitate advanced
research on hallucination detection, multilingual evaluation of LLMs, and the
development of more reliable scientific NLP systems.

Conclusion: CHOIR通过将人物角色变化重构为有益信号，为提升LLM推理可靠性提供了可扩展的通用方法。

Abstract: Persona-assigned Large Language Models (LLMs) can adopt diverse roles,
enabling personalized and context-aware reasoning. However, even minor
demographic perturbations in personas, such as simple pronoun changes, can
alter reasoning trajectories, leading to divergent sets of correct answers.
Instead of treating these variations as biases to be mitigated, we explore
their potential as a constructive resource to improve reasoning robustness. We
propose CHOIR (Collaborative Harmonization fOr Inference Robustness), a
test-time framework that harmonizes multiple persona-conditioned reasoning
signals into a unified prediction. CHOIR orchestrates a collaborative decoding
process among counterfactual personas, dynamically balancing agreement and
divergence in their reasoning paths. Experiments on various reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that CHOIR consistently enhances performance across
demographics, model architectures, scales, and tasks - without additional
training. Improvements reach up to 26.4% for individual demographic groups and
19.2% on average across five demographics. It remains effective even when base
personas are suboptimal. By reframing persona variation as a constructive
signal, CHOIR provides a scalable and generalizable approach to more reliable
LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 传统研究通过比较重建和声学语音学探索音调形成（tonogenesis），本研究旨在引入计算方法，量化音高在不同变音阶段的功能作用。

Method: 通过测量音高平坦化对自动语音识别（ASR）性能的影响，分析一组密切相关的藏语方言对音高敏感度。

Result: 研究发现了一个音调形成的连续体：非声调的安多方言对音高去除最耐受，完全声调的卫藏方言表现严重退化，而中间的康方言介于两者之间。

Conclusion: 计算方法能捕捉音变的细粒度阶段，传统的最小对立功能负荷指标可能高估了音高在过渡系统中的依赖程度。

Abstract: Tonogenesis-the historical process by which segmental contrasts evolve into
lexical tone-has traditionally been studied through comparative reconstruction
and acoustic phonetics. We introduce a computational approach that quantifies
the functional role of pitch at different stages of this sound change by
measuring how pitch manipulation affects automatic speech recognition (ASR)
performance. Through analysis on the sensitivity to pitch-flattening from a set
of closely related Tibetan languages, we find evidence of a tonogenesis
continuum: atonal Amdo dialects tolerate pitch removal the most, while fully
tonal U-Tsang varieties show severe degradation, and intermediate Kham dialects
fall measurably between these extremes. These gradient effects demonstrate how
ASR models implicitly learn the shifting functional load of pitch as languages
transition from consonant-based to tone-based lexical contrasts. Our findings
show that computational methods can capture fine-grained stages of sound change
and suggest that traditional functional load metrics, based solely on minimal
pairs, may overestimate pitch dependence in transitional systems where
segmental and suprasegmental cues remain phonetically intertwined.

Abstract: Pruning provides a practical solution to reduce the resources required to run
large language models (LLMs) to benefit from their effective capabilities as
well as control their cost for training and inference. Research on LLM pruning
often ranks the importance of LLM parameters using their magnitudes and
calibration-data activations and removes (or masks) the less important ones,
accordingly reducing LLMs' size. However, these approaches primarily focus on
preserving the LLM's ability to generate fluent sentences, while neglecting
performance on specific domains and tasks. In this paper, we propose a simple
yet effective pruning approach for LLMs that preserves task-specific
capabilities while shrinking their parameter space. We first analyze how
conventional pruning minimizes loss perturbation under general-domain
calibration and extend this formulation by incorporating task-specific feature
distributions into the importance computation of existing pruning algorithms.
Thus, our framework computes separate importance scores using both general and
task-specific calibration data, partitions parameters into shared and exclusive
groups based on activation-norm differences, and then fuses their scores to
guide the pruning process. This design enables our method to integrate
seamlessly with various foundation pruning techniques and preserve the LLM's
specialized abilities under compression. Experiments on widely used benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach is effective and consistently outperforms the
baselines with identical pruning ratios and different settings.

sub-token inventory across languages, and does data disparity in multilingual
pre-training affect how these tokens are utilized during inference? We address
this question by analyzing Whisper's decoding behavior during inference across
49 languages. By logging decoding candidate sub-tokens and tracking their
cumulative discovery over time, we study the utilization pattern of the model's
sub-token space. Results show that the total number of discovered tokens
remains largely independent of a language's pre-training hours, indicating that
data disparity does not strongly influence lexical diversity in the model's
hypothesis space. Sub-token discovery rates follow a consistent exponential
saturation pattern across languages, suggesting a stable time window after
which additional audio yields minimal new sub-token activation. We refer to
this convergence threshold as acoustic saturation time (AST). Further analyses
of rank-frequency distributions reveal Zipf-like patterns better modeled by a
Zipf-Mandelbrot law, and mean sub-token length shows a positive correlation
with resource level. Additionally, those metrics show more favorable patterns
for languages in the Latin script than those in scripts such as Cyrillic, CJK,
and Semitic. Together, our study suggests that sub-token utilization during
multilingual ASR inference is constrained more by the statistical, typological,
and orthographic structure of the speech than by training data scale, providing
an empirical basis for more equitable corpus construction and cross-lingual
evaluation.

*Michael Scott,Siyu Liang,Alicia Wassink,Gina-Anne Levow*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过对四种主要商业自动语音识别（ASR）系统的系统评估，揭示了种族偏见。研究发现，语音质量变化（尤其是对某些元音模式的抵抗）与社会语音注释中的特定变量相关，导致不同种族群体的错误率差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究的动机是评估商业ASR系统中存在的种族偏见，特别关注社会语音变化如何导致不同种族群体的识别性能差异。

Method: 研究使用了太平洋西北英语（PNWE）语料库，分析了来自四种不同种族背景的说话者的转录准确性，并引入了语音错误率（PER）指标，将识别错误与社会语音特征联系起来。

Result: 研究发现，元音质量变化（如对低后元音合并和鼻前元音合并模式的抵抗）显著影响ASR系统的错误率，尤其是对非裔美国人说话者的影响最大。

Conclusion: 研究表明，方言语音变化的声学建模是商业ASR系统偏见的主要来源。研究建议通过在训练数据中更有针对性地包含社会语音多样性来提高ASR性能。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic evaluation of racial bias in four major
commercial automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems using the Pacific
Northwest English (PNWE) corpus. We analyze transcription accuracy across
speakers from four ethnic backgrounds (African American, Caucasian American,
ChicanX, and Yakama) and examine how sociophonetic variation contributes to
differential system performance. We introduce a heuristically-determined
Phonetic Error Rate (PER) metric that links recognition errors to specific
linguistically motivated variables derived from sociophonetic annotation. Our
analysis of eleven sociophonetic features reveals that vowel quality variation,
particularly resistance to the low-back merger and pre-nasal merger patterns,
is systematically associated with differential error rates across ethnic
groups, with the most pronounced effects for African American speakers across
all evaluated systems. These findings demonstrate that acoustic modeling of
dialectal phonetic variation, rather than lexical or syntactic factors, remains
a primary source of bias in commercial ASR systems. The study establishes the
PNWE corpus as a valuable resource for bias evaluation in speech technologies
and provides actionable guidance for improving ASR performance through targeted
representation of sociophonetic diversity in training data.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了针对法律文本中不公平条款检测的不同适应策略，发现全微调效果最佳，而低秩适应（LoRA）在内存效率上更具优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在法律领域的适应受到全微调高成本的限制，研究旨在探索成本更低、效率更高的适应方法。

Method: 研究采用了全微调BERT和DistilBERT，应用4位LoRA适配TinyLlama等模型，并在零样本设置下评估GPT-4o及其变体。

Result: 全微调在精确度和召回率上表现最佳，而LoRA模型在内存成本降低3倍的情况下仍保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 研究为法律文本处理中的高效域适应提供了实用设计权衡，并贡献了公开基线数据。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed text understanding, yet their
adaptation to specialized legal domains remains constrained by the cost of full
fine-tuning. This study provides a systematic evaluation of fine tuning,
parameter efficient adaptation (LoRA, QLoRA), and zero-shot prompting
strategies for unfair clause detection in Terms of Service (ToS) documents, a
key application in legal NLP. We finetune BERT and DistilBERT, apply 4-bit
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to models such as TinyLlama, LLaMA 3B/7B, and
SaulLM, and evaluate GPT-4o and O-versions in zero-shot settings. Experiments
on the CLAUDETTE-ToS benchmark and the Multilingual Scraper Corpus show that
full fine-tuning achieves the strongest precision recall balance, while
LoRA-based models provide competitive recall with up to 3x lower memory cost.
These findings highlight practical design trade-offs for efficient and
domain-adapted LLMs, contributing open baselines for fine-tuning research in
legal text processing.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的长上下文理解能力在现实任务中表现不足，且缺乏相关评测基准。

Method: 通过自动收集16k至2M token的现实长文本（涵盖法律、金融、游戏和代码领域），设计了10类长依赖任务并生成1,934个多样化的QA实例，评估了6个本地部署和4个API模型的性能。

Result: 最佳模型的总体得分仅为59.2%，表明现有模型的实际理解能力远低于其宣称的长上下文容量。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了现有大语言模型在长依赖任务中的显著局限，强调了其在现实应用中的改进空间。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are equipped with increasingly extended context
windows recently, yet their long context understanding capabilities over long
dependency tasks remain fundamentally limited and underexplored. This gap is
especially significant in many real-world long-context applications that were
rarely benchmarked. In this paper, we introduce LooGLE v2, a novel benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs' long context ability in real-world applications and
scenarios. Our benchmark consists of automatically collected real-world long
texts, ranging from 16k to 2M tokens, encompassing domains in law, finance,
game and code. Accordingly, we delicately design 10 types of domain-specific
long-dependency tasks and generate 1,934 QA instances with various diversity
and complexity in a scalable data curation pipeline for further practical
needs. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of 6 locally deployed and 4
API-based LLMs. The evaluation results show that even the best-performing model
achieves only a 59.2% overall score on our benchmark. Despite the extensive
context windows, popular LLMs are only capable of understanding a much shorter
length of context than they claim to be, revealing significant limitations in
their ability to handle real-world tasks with long dependencies and
highlighting substantial room for model improvement in practical long-context
understanding.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: The growing memory footprint of the Key-Value (KV) cache poses a severe
scalability bottleneck for long-context Large Language Model (LLM) inference.
While KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution by discarding less
critical tokens, existing token-, block-, and sentence-level compression
methods struggle to balance semantic coherence and memory efficiency. To this
end, we introduce SABlock, a \underline{s}emantic-aware KV cache eviction
framework with \underline{a}daptive \underline{block} sizes. Specifically,
SABlock first performs semantic segmentation to align compression boundaries
with linguistic structures, then applies segment-guided token scoring to refine
token importance estimation. Finally, for each segment, a budget-driven search
strategy adaptively determines the optimal block size that preserves semantic
integrity while improving compression efficiency under a given cache budget.
Extensive experiments on long-context benchmarks demonstrate that SABlock
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the same memory
budgets. For instance, on Needle-in-a-Haystack (NIAH), SABlock achieves 99.9%
retrieval accuracy with only 96 KV entries, nearly matching the performance of
the full-cache baseline that retains up to 8K entries. Under a fixed cache
budget of 1,024, SABlock further reduces peak memory usage by 46.28% and
achieves up to 9.5x faster decoding on a 128K context length.

TL;DR: 摘要讨论了人工智能在教育（AIED）领域的跨学科研究，尤其是通过大语言模型（LLM）驱动的智能辅导系统（ITS）的发展。然而，由于缺乏可靠的、普遍接受的评价框架和基准，这些系统的进展和影响难以追踪。论文提供了最新的评价实践，并通过案例研究提出三个基于学习科学的、实际可行的研究方向，旨在建立公平、统一且可扩展的评价方法。


<details>

Motivation: 当前AIED领域的智能辅导系统（ITS）发展迅速，尤其是基于大语言模型的系统，但其评价缺乏标准化框架，导致不一致性和局限性。因此，研究旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 论文通过回顾现有的评价实践，结合真实案例研究，总结了相关挑战，并提出了三个基于学习科学的、实际可行的研究方向。

Result: 研究发现当前ITS评价存在主观性和非标准化的问题，导致不一致性和通用性有限。

Conclusion: 论文建议通过跨学科研究，建立公平、统一且可扩展的评价方法，以推动AIED领域的进步。

Abstract: The interdisciplinary research domain of Artificial Intelligence in Education
(AIED) has a long history of developing Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) by
integrating insights from technological advancements, educational theories, and
cognitive psychology. The remarkable success of generative AI (GenAI) models
has accelerated the development of large language model (LLM)-powered ITSs,
which have potential to imitate human-like, pedagogically rich, and cognitively
demanding tutoring. However, the progress and impact of these systems remain
largely untraceable due to the absence of reliable, universally accepted, and
pedagogy-driven evaluation frameworks and benchmarks. Most existing educational
dialogue-based ITS evaluations rely on subjective protocols and
non-standardized benchmarks, leading to inconsistencies and limited
generalizability. In this work, we take a step back from mainstream ITS
development and provide comprehensive state-of-the-art evaluation practices,
highlighting associated challenges through real-world case studies from careful
and caring AIED research. Finally, building on insights from previous
interdisciplinary AIED research, we propose three practical, feasible, and
theoretically grounded research directions, rooted in learning science
principles and aimed at establishing fair, unified, and scalable evaluation
methodologies for ITSs.

Motivation: 现有静态基准存在测试集污染和适应性不足的问题，需一种动态、抗污染的评估方法。

Method: AutoBench让LLM交替充当问题生成器、参赛者和评委，通过迭代加权机制整合多评委结果。

Result: 实验显示AutoBench与传统基准MMLU-Pro和GPQA的相关性分别为78%和63%，且多评委设计优于单评委。

Conclusion: AutoBench为持续评估语言模型提供了可扩展且抗污染的动态基准解决方案。

Abstract: We present AutoBench, a fully automated and self-sustaining framework for
evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) through reciprocal peer assessment.
This paper provides a rigorous scientific validation of the AutoBench
methodology, originally developed as an open-source project by eZecute S.R.L..
Unlike static benchmarks that suffer from test-set contamination and limited
adaptability, AutoBench dynamically generates novel evaluation tasks while
models alternately serve as question generators, contestants, and judges across
diverse domains. An iterative weighting mechanism amplifies the influence of
consistently reliable evaluators, aggregating peer judgments into
consensus-based rankings that reflect collective model agreement. Our
experiments demonstrate strong correlations with established benchmarks
including MMLU-Pro and GPQA (respectively 78\% and 63\%), validating this
peer-driven evaluation paradigm. The multi-judge design significantly
outperforms single-judge baselines, confirming that distributed evaluation
produces more robust and human-consistent assessments. AutoBench offers a
scalable, contamination-resistant alternative to static benchmarks for the
continuous evaluation of evolving language models.

Conclusion: PerCoR填补波斯语常识推理空白，DRESS-AF有效提升数据集难度，推动相关研究。

Abstract: We introduced PerCoR (Persian Commonsense Reasoning), the first large-scale
Persian benchmark for commonsense reasoning. PerCoR contains 106K
multiple-choice sentence-completion problems drawn from more than forty news,
cultural, and other web sources. We introduce a novel conjunction-based
segmentation strategy to generate coherent sentence-completion pairs, enabling
broad topical and structural diversity. To create challenging distractors, we
propose DRESS-AF (Distractor Ranking via Embedding Similarity Scoring and
Adversarial Filtering), a generation-free adversarial filtering method that
selects distractors from the pool of gold continuations while maximising model
confusion. Human annotators score 89% on PerCoR, while OpenAI-o3 achieves the
highest performance at 92.18%, followed closely by Claude-Sonnet-3.7 (91.17%).
The strongest open-source model, DeepSeek-R1, reaches 82.51%, underscoring both
the dataset's difficulty and the remaining performance gap in Persian
commonsense reasoning. We further show that DRESS-AF transfers to the English
HellaSwag benchmark, increasing its difficulty without hurting human
solvability. The dataset is available at

Abstract: Preserving linguistic diversity is necessary as every language offers a
distinct perspective on the world. There have been numerous global initiatives
to preserve endangered languages through documentation. This paper is a part of
a project which aims to develop a trilingual (Toto-Bangla-English) language
learning application to digitally archive and promote the endangered Toto
language of West Bengal, India. This application, designed for both native Toto
speakers and non-native learners, aims to revitalize the language by ensuring
accessibility and usability through Unicode script integration and a structured
language corpus. The research includes detailed linguistic documentation
collected via fieldwork, followed by the creation of a morpheme-tagged,
trilingual corpus used to train a Small Language Model (SLM) and a
Transformer-based translation engine. The analysis covers inflectional
morphology such as person-number-gender agreement, tense-aspect-mood
distinctions, and case marking, alongside derivational strategies that reflect
word-class changes. Script standardization and digital literacy tools were also
developed to enhance script usage. The study offers a sustainable model for
preserving endangered languages by incorporating traditional linguistic
methodology with AI. This bridge between linguistic research with technological
innovation highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration for
community-based language revitalization.

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有最优方法。

Conclusion: CR-FKGC通过综合高阶信息和共轭关系建模，有效解决了少样本知识图谱完成中的挑战。

Abstract: Few-shot Knowledge Graph Completion (FKGC) infers missing triples from
limited support samples, tackling long-tail distribution challenges. Existing
methods, however, struggle to capture complex relational patterns and mitigate
data sparsity. To address these challenges, we propose a novel FKGC framework
for conjugate relation modeling (CR-FKGC). Specifically, it employs a
neighborhood aggregation encoder to integrate higher-order neighbor
information, a conjugate relation learner combining an implicit conditional
diffusion relation module with a stable relation module to capture stable
semantics and uncertainty offsets, and a manifold conjugate decoder for
efficient evaluation and inference of missing triples in manifold space.
Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves superior
performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有规则多用于解释传统机器学习模型，而RAG-LLMs的规则解释尚未被研究。本文填补了这一空白。

Result: 通过定性和定量实验验证了方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 为RAG-LLMs的规则解释提供了可行且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: If-then rules are widely used to explain machine learning models; e.g., "if
employed = no, then loan application = rejected." We present the first proposal
to apply rules to explain the emerging class of large language models (LLMs)
with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Since RAG enables LLM systems to
incorporate retrieved information sources at inference time, rules linking the
presence or absence of sources can explain output provenance; e.g., "if a Times
Higher Education ranking article is retrieved, then the LLM ranks Oxford
first." To generate such rules, a brute force approach would probe the LLM with
all source combinations and check if the presence or absence of any sources
leads to the same output. We propose optimizations to speed up rule generation,
inspired by Apriori-like pruning from frequent itemset mining but redefined
within the scope of our novel problem. We conclude with qualitative and
quantitative experiments demonstrating our solutions' value and efficiency.

cold-start training. Each class label is mapped to a distinct output token, and
prompts are constructed to elicit a single-token response. During inference,
the model's output is projected only onto the logits of the relevant class
tokens, enabling efficient and accurate classification in a single forward
pass. SALSA achieves state-of-the-art results across diverse benchmarks,
demonstrating its robustness and scalability for LLM-based classification
applications.

Abstract: Text embedding models serve as a fundamental component in real-world search
applications. By mapping queries and documents into a shared embedding space,
they deliver competitive retrieval performance with high efficiency. However,
their ranking fidelity remains limited compared to dedicated rerankers,
especially recent LLM-based listwise rerankers, which capture fine-grained
query-document and document-document interactions. In this paper, we propose a
simple yet effective unified framework $\text{E}^2\text{Rank}$, means Efficient
Embedding-based Ranking (also means Embedding-to-Rank), which extends a single
text embedding model to perform both high-quality retrieval and listwise
reranking through continued training under a listwise ranking objective,
thereby achieving strong effectiveness with remarkable efficiency. By applying
cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings as a unified
ranking function, the listwise ranking prompt, which is constructed from the
original query and its candidate documents, serves as an enhanced query
enriched with signals from the top-K documents, akin to pseudo-relevance
feedback (PRF) in traditional retrieval models. This design preserves the
efficiency and representational quality of the base embedding model while
significantly improving its reranking performance. Empirically,
$\textrm{E}^2\text{Rank}$ achieves state-of-the-art results on the BEIR
reranking benchmark and demonstrates competitive performance on the
reasoning-intensive BRIGHT benchmark, with very low reranking latency. We also
show that the ranking training process improves embedding performance on the
MTEB benchmark. Our findings indicate that a single embedding model can
effectively unify retrieval and reranking, offering both computational
efficiency and competitive ranking accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）被广泛采用，但其最强能力仍局限于少数高资源语言。本研究旨在通过CPT和PEFT方法，将这些模型适应于低资源方言，以扩展高质量LLMs对少数语言社区的访问。

Method: 采用低秩适应（LoRA）和计算高效的持续预训练方法，使用极小数据集将三种LLMs适应于魁北克法语方言，并在COLE基准套件上进行测试。

Result: 实验结果表明，在仅更新不到1%模型参数的情况下，少数民族方言基准测试有所提升，同时标准语言基准测试表现基本无退化。结果还显示，效果高度依赖于语料库的组成。

Conclusion: 研究证实，结合CPT和PEFT的方法可以为少数语言社区提供成本效益高且可持续的语言资源创建方式，缩小方言差距。首批魁北克法语LLMs已在HuggingFace上发布。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs), their
strongest capabilities remain largely confined to a small number of
high-resource languages for which there is abundant training data. Recently,
continual pre-training (CPT) has emerged as a means to fine-tune these models
to low-resource regional dialects. In this paper, we study the use of CPT for
dialect learning under tight data and compute budgets. Using low-rank
adaptation (LoRA) and compute-efficient continual pre-training, we adapt three
LLMs to the Qu\'ebec French dialect using a very small dataset and benchmark
them on the COLE suite. Our experiments demonstrate an improvement on the
minority dialect benchmarks with minimal regression on the prestige language
benchmarks with under 1% of model parameters updated. Analysis of the results
demonstrate that gains are highly contingent on corpus composition. These
findings indicate that CPT with parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) can
narrow the dialect gap by providing cost-effective and sustainable language
resource creation, expanding high-quality LLM access to minority linguistic
communities. We release the first Qu\'ebec French LLMs on HuggingFace.

Abstract: In-context learning is governed by both temporal and semantic relationships,
shaping how Large Language Models (LLMs) retrieve contextual information.
Analogous to human episodic memory, where the retrieval of specific events is
enabled by separating events that happened at different times, this work probes
the ability of various pretrained LLMs, including transformer and state-space
models, to differentiate and retrieve temporally separated events.
Specifically, we prompted models with sequences containing multiple
presentations of the same token, which reappears at the sequence end. By fixing
the positions of these repeated tokens and permuting all others, we removed
semantic confounds and isolated temporal effects on next-token prediction.
Across diverse sequences, models consistently placed the highest probabilities
on tokens following a repeated token, but with a notable bias for those nearest
the beginning or end of the input. An ablation experiment linked this
phenomenon in transformers to induction heads. Extending the analysis to unique
semantic contexts with partial overlap further demonstrated that memories
embedded in the middle of a prompt are retrieved less reliably. Despite
architectural differences, state-space and transformer models showed comparable
temporal biases. Our findings deepen the understanding of temporal biases in
in-context learning and offer an illustration of how these biases can enable
temporal separation and episodic retrieval.

Motivation: 研究语音语言模型是否能整合非词汇声音线索与语言内容，以实现人类般的共情对话能力。

Method: 提出EchoMind基准测试，包含口语内容理解、声音线索感知、整合推理和生成回应四个任务，并通过39种声音属性和主客观指标评估模型表现。

Result: 测试12个先进语音语言模型发现，即使最先进的模型也难以处理高表达性声音线索，影响共情回应质量。

Conclusion: 需开发能整合语言内容和多样声音线索的语音语言模型，以提升共情对话能力。

Abstract: Speech Language Models (SLMs) have made significant progress in spoken
language understanding. Yet it remains unclear whether they can fully perceive
non lexical vocal cues alongside spoken words, and respond with empathy that
aligns with both emotional and contextual factors. Existing benchmarks
typically evaluate linguistic, acoustic, reasoning, or dialogue abilities in
isolation, overlooking the integration of these skills that is crucial for
human-like, emotionally intelligent conversation. We present EchoMind, the
first interrelated, multi-level benchmark that simulates the cognitive process
of empathetic dialogue through sequential, context-linked tasks: spoken-content
understanding, vocal-cue perception, integrated reasoning, and response
generation. All tasks share identical and semantically neutral scripts that are
free of explicit emotional or contextual cues, and controlled variations in
vocal style are used to test the effect of delivery independent of the
transcript. EchoMind is grounded in an empathy-oriented framework spanning 3
coarse and 12 fine-grained dimensions, encompassing 39 vocal attributes, and
evaluated using both objective and subjective metrics. Testing 12 advanced SLMs
reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with high-expressive vocal
cues, limiting empathetic response quality. Analyses of prompt strength, speech
source, and ideal vocal cue recognition reveal persistent weaknesses in
instruction-following, resilience to natural speech variability, and effective
use of vocal cues for empathy. These results underscore the need for SLMs that
integrate linguistic content with diverse vocal cues to achieve truly
empathetic conversational ability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究 LVLMs在多模态 persuasive内容中的 susceptibility和 persuasion策略的有效性，以避免模型被 manipulative messages影响而导致误导、违背用户偏好或生成不道德/不安全的输出。

Method: 引入 MMPersuade框架，包括一个多模态数据集（涵盖商业、主观行为及对抗性场景）和评估框架（通过第三方 agreement scoring和 token probabilities分析 persuasion效果和模型 susceptibility）。

Result: 研究发现：(i)多模态输入比纯文本更具 persuasion效果；(ii)显式偏好可降低 susceptibility，但多模态仍保持优势；(iii)不同策略在不同场景中效果不同（如 reciprocity在商业/主观场景最有效，credibility/logic在对抗场景中占优）。

Conclusion: MMPersuade为开发 robust、preference-consistent且 ethically aligned的 LVLMs提供了理论支持。

Abstract: As Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) are increasingly deployed in domains
such as shopping, health, and news, they are exposed to pervasive persuasive
content. A critical question is how these models function as persuadees-how and
why they can be influenced by persuasive multimodal inputs. Understanding both
their susceptibility to persuasion and the effectiveness of different
persuasive strategies is crucial, as overly persuadable models may adopt
misleading beliefs, override user preferences, or generate unethical or unsafe
outputs when exposed to manipulative messages. We introduce MMPersuade, a
unified framework for systematically studying multimodal persuasion dynamics in
LVLMs. MMPersuade contributes (i) a comprehensive multimodal dataset that pairs
images and videos with established persuasion principles across commercial,
subjective and behavioral, and adversarial contexts, and (ii) an evaluation
framework that quantifies both persuasion effectiveness and model
susceptibility via third-party agreement scoring and self-estimated token
probabilities on conversation histories. Our study of six leading LVLMs as
persuadees yields three key insights: (i) multimodal inputs substantially
increase persuasion effectiveness-and model susceptibility-compared to text
alone, especially in misinformation scenarios; (ii) stated prior preferences
decrease susceptibility, yet multimodal information maintains its persuasive
advantage; and (iii) different strategies vary in effectiveness across
contexts, with reciprocity being most potent in commercial and subjective
contexts, and credibility and logic prevailing in adversarial contexts. By
jointly analyzing persuasion effectiveness and susceptibility, MMPersuade
provides a principled foundation for developing models that are robust,
preference-consistent, and ethically aligned when engaging with persuasive
multimodal content.

performance among open-source models and approaches the accuracy of proprietary
systems, demonstrating its potential as a scalable and accessible tool for
automated math assessment. Our training and experiment code is publicly

Method: 通过78,000次多语言推理评估了六种模型（四种商业对齐模型和两种开源模型），使用了标准分类指标和新提出的跨语言可靠性指标。

Result: 对齐模型在低资源语言中表现出更高的稳定性和校准平衡，而开源模型显示出显著的提示语言敏感性和校准漂移。

Conclusion: 多语言对齐模型适合资源受限的人道主义组织，提供了预算与可靠性之间平衡的实用建议。

Abstract: Humanitarian organizations face a critical choice: invest in costly
commercial APIs or rely on free open-weight models for multilingual human
rights monitoring. While commercial systems offer reliability, open-weight
alternatives lack empirical validation -- especially for low-resource languages
common in conflict zones. This paper presents the first systematic comparison
of commercial and open-weight large language models (LLMs) for
human-rights-violation detection across seven languages, quantifying the
cost-reliability trade-off facing resource-constrained organizations. Across
78,000 multilingual inferences, we evaluate six models -- four
instruction-aligned (Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3, Gemini-Flash-2.0,
GPT-4.1-mini) and two open-weight (LLaMA-3-8B, Mistral-7B) -- using both
standard classification metrics and new measures of cross-lingual reliability:
Calibration Deviation (CD), Decision Bias (B), Language Robustness Score (LRS),
and Language Stability Score (LSS). Results show that alignment, not scale,
determines stability: aligned models maintain near-invariant accuracy and
balanced calibration across typologically distant and low-resource languages
(e.g., Lingala, Burmese), while open-weight models exhibit significant
prompt-language sensitivity and calibration drift. These findings demonstrate
that multilingual alignment enables language-agnostic reasoning and provide
practical guidance for humanitarian organizations balancing budget constraints
with reliability in multilingual deployment.

Abstract: Understanding how ideas develop and flow in small-group conversations is
critical for analyzing collaborative learning. A key structural feature of
these interactions is threading, the way discourse talk naturally organizes
into interwoven topical strands that evolve over time. While threading has been
widely studied in asynchronous text settings, detecting threads in synchronous
spoken dialogue remains challenging due to overlapping turns and implicit cues.
At the same time, large language models (LLMs) show promise for automating
discourse analysis but often struggle with long-context tasks that depend on
tracing these conversational links. In this paper, we investigate whether
explicit thread linkages can improve LLM-based coding of relational moves in
group talk. We contribute a systematic guidebook for identifying threads in
synchronous multi-party transcripts and benchmark different LLM prompting
strategies for automated threading. We then test how threading influences
performance on downstream coding of conversational analysis frameworks, that
capture core collaborative actions such as agreeing, building, and eliciting.
Our results show that providing clear conversational thread information
improves LLM coding performance and underscores the heavy reliance of
downstream analysis on well-structured dialogue. We also discuss practical
trade-offs in time and cost, emphasizing where human-AI hybrid approaches can
yield the best value. Together, this work advances methods for combining LLMs
and robust conversational thread structures to make sense of complex, real-time
group interactions.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在复杂多步推理方面仍有不足，现有方法如CoT和PoT虽有改进，但在算法领域常生成不理想的解决方案。

Method: PIPS通过实例级程序生成和结构反馈动态选择推理方式，无需任务特定指导或显式测试用例。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PIPS显著提升准确率并减少不理想程序生成。

Conclusion: PIPS是提升大型语言模型复杂推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to
struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs
with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of
Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions,
especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis
(PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level
using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit
test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence
metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis
on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30
benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question
answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks
show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and
9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program
generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with
Gemini-2.0-Flash.

Abstract: Understanding how the human brain progresses from processing simple
linguistic inputs to performing high-level reasoning is a fundamental challenge
in neuroscience. While modern large language models (LLMs) are increasingly
used to model neural responses to language, their internal representations are
highly "entangled," mixing information about lexicon, syntax, meaning, and
reasoning. This entanglement biases conventional brain encoding analyses toward
linguistically shallow features (e.g., lexicon and syntax), making it difficult
to isolate the neural substrates of cognitively deeper processes. Here, we
introduce a residual disentanglement method that computationally isolates these
components. By first probing an LM to identify feature-specific layers, our
method iteratively regresses out lower-level representations to produce four
nearly orthogonal embeddings for lexicon, syntax, meaning, and, critically,
reasoning. We used these disentangled embeddings to model intracranial (ECoG)
brain recordings from neurosurgical patients listening to natural speech. We
show that: 1) This isolated reasoning embedding exhibits unique predictive
power, accounting for variance in neural activity not explained by other
linguistic features and even extending to the recruitment of visual regions
beyond classical language areas. 2) The neural signature for reasoning is
temporally distinct, peaking later (~350-400ms) than signals related to
lexicon, syntax, and meaning, consistent with its position atop a processing
hierarchy. 3) Standard, non-disentangled LLM embeddings can be misleading, as
their predictive success is primarily attributable to linguistically shallow
features, masking the more subtle contributions of deeper cognitive processing.

Abstract: Despite their impressive capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit
unwanted uncertainty, a phenomenon where a model changes a previously correct
answer into an incorrect one when re-prompted. This behavior undermines trust
and poses serious risks in high-stakes domains. In this work, we investigate
the mechanisms that drive this phenomenon. We adapt the Needle-in-a-Haystack
retrieval framework and integrate a Flip-style re-evaluation prompt to simulate
realistic answer-flipping scenarios. We find that retrieval heads are not
primarily responsible for avoiding uncertainty. Instead, we identify a small
set of non-retrieval attention heads that disproportionately attend to
misleading tokens in uncertain contexts. Masking these heads yields significant
improvements, reducing flip behavior by up to 15% without introducing
incoherence or overcorrection. However, when tested for downstream tasks, we
observe trade-offs with flip behavior. Our findings contribute to the growing
field of mechanistic interpretability and present a simple yet effective
technique for mitigating uncertainty-driven failure modes in LLMs.

Motivation: 为了解决推测解码在批处理过程中出现的非对齐张量问题（ragged tensor problem），确保输出的一致性，同时提升吞吐量。

Method: 1. 定义同步需求以保证正确性；2. 提出EQSPEC方法，发现重新对齐占用40%的开销；3. 引入EXSPEC方法，动态分组以降低重新对齐开销。

Result: 在SpecBench数据集上，使用Vicuna-7B/68M、Qwen3-8B/0.6B和GLM-4-9B/0.6B模型对，批处理大小为8时吞吐量提升3倍，输出一致性保持在95%。

Conclusion: EQSPEC和EXSPEC方法有效解决了非对齐张量问题，显著提升了吞吐量且无需定制内核，易于集成到现有推理框架中。

Abstract: Speculative decoding speeds up LLM inference by using a small draft model to
propose multiple tokens that a target model verifies in parallel. Extending
this idea to batches is essential for production serving, but it introduces the
ragged tensor problem: sequences in the same batch accept different numbers of
draft tokens, breaking right-alignment and corrupting position IDs, attention
masks, and KV-cache state. We show that several existing batch implementations
violate output equivalence-the fundamental requirement that speculative
decoding must produce identical token sequences to standard autoregressive
generation. These violations occur precisely due to improper handling of the
ragged tensor problem. In response, we (1) characterize the synchronization
requirements that guarantee correctness, (2) present a correctness-first batch
speculative decoding EQSPEC that exposes realignment as consuming 40% of
overhead, and (3) introduce EXSPEC, which maintains a sliding pool of sequences
and dynamically forms same-length groups, to reduce the realignment overhead
while preserving per-sequence speculative speedups. On the SpecBench dataset,
across Vicuna-7B/68M, Qwen3-8B/0.6B, and GLM-4-9B/0.6B target/draft pairs, our
approach achieves up to 3$\times$ throughput improvement at batch size 8
compared to batch size 1, with efficient scaling through batch size 8, while
maintaining 95% output equivalence. Our method requires no custom kernels and
integrates cleanly with existing inference stacks. Our code is available at

Abstract: Large language models routinely hallucinate APIs and mislocalize edits, while
language servers compute verified, IDE-grade facts about real code. We present
Lanser-CLI, a CLI-first orchestration layer that pins and mediates a Language
Server Protocol (LSP) server for coding agents and CI, exposing deterministic,
replayable workflows. Our position is that language servers provide not only
structural information (definitions, references, types, diagnostics) but also
an actionable process reward: machine-checked, step-wise signals that align an
agent's planning loop with program reality. In this work, Lanser-CLI
contributes: (i) a robust addressing scheme beyond brittle "file:line:col" via
a Selector DSL (symbolic, AST-path, and content-anchored selectors) with a
principled relocation algorithm; (ii) deterministic Analysis Bundles that
normalize Language Server responses and capture environment/capability metadata
with stable content hashes; (iii) a safety envelope for mutating operations
(rename, code actions) with preview, workspace jails, and Git-aware,
transactional apply; and (iv) a process-reward functional derived from Language
Server facts (diagnostic deltas, disambiguation confidence, and safe-apply
checks) that is computable online and replayable offline. We formalize
determinism under frozen snapshots and establish a monotonicity property for
the process reward, making it suitable for process supervision and
counterfactual analysis. Project Page:

Motivation: 语言模型在生成多样性和创造性内容方面存在局限，可能导致人类思维的长期同质化，但现有的评估方法有限。

Method: 通过Infinity-Chat数据集（26K开放式查询和31K人类标注）和首个开放式提示分类法，研究了LMs的模式崩溃现象。

Result: 发现LMs存在显著的Artificial Hivemind效应，表现为模型内和模型间的输出同质化，且LM对人类偏好的校准不足。

Conclusion: Infinity-Chat为系统性研究开放式查询提供了大规模资源，揭示了未来研究的关键方向以缓解AI安全风险。

Abstract: Language models (LMs) often struggle to generate diverse, human-like creative
content, raising concerns about the long-term homogenization of human thought
through repeated exposure to similar outputs. Yet scalable methods for
evaluating LM output diversity remain limited, especially beyond narrow tasks
such as random number or name generation, or beyond repeated sampling from a
single model. We introduce Infinity-Chat, a large-scale dataset of 26K diverse,
real-world, open-ended user queries that admit a wide range of plausible
answers with no single ground truth. We introduce the first comprehensive
taxonomy for characterizing the full spectrum of open-ended prompts posed to
LMs, comprising 6 top-level categories (e.g., brainstorm & ideation) that
further breaks down to 17 subcategories. Using Infinity-Chat, we present a
large-scale study of mode collapse in LMs, revealing a pronounced Artificial
Hivemind effect in open-ended generation of LMs, characterized by (1)
intra-model repetition, where a single model consistently generates similar
responses, and more so (2) inter-model homogeneity, where different models
produce strikingly similar outputs. Infinity-Chat also includes 31,250 human
annotations, across absolute ratings and pairwise preferences, with 25
independent human annotations per example. This enables studying collective and
individual-specific human preferences in response to open-ended queries. Our
findings show that LMs, reward models, and LM judges are less well calibrated
to human ratings on model generations that elicit differing idiosyncratic
annotator preferences, despite maintaining comparable overall quality. Overall,
INFINITY-CHAT presents the first large-scale resource for systematically
studying real-world open-ended queries to LMs, revealing critical insights to
guide future research for mitigating long-term AI safety risks posed by the
Artificial Hivemind.

Abstract: Recent investigations into effective context lengths of modern flagship large
language models (LLMs) have revealed major limitations in effective question
answering (QA) and reasoning over long and complex contexts for even the
largest and most impressive cadre of models. While approaches like
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and chunk-based re-ranking attempt to
mitigate this issue, they are sensitive to chunking, embedding and retrieval
strategies and models, and furthermore, rely on extensive pre-processing,
knowledge acquisition and indexing steps. In this paper, we propose
Tagging-Augmented Generation (TAG), a lightweight data augmentation strategy
that boosts LLM performance in long-context scenarios, without degrading and
altering the integrity and composition of retrieved documents. We validate our
hypothesis by augmenting two challenging and directly relevant
question-answering benchmarks -- NoLima and NovelQA -- and show that tagging
the context or even just adding tag definitions into QA prompts leads to
consistent performance gains over the baseline -- up to 17% for 32K token
contexts, and 2.9% in complex reasoning question-answering for multi-hop
queries requiring knowledge across a wide span of text. Additional details are

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于句子嵌入的定制LLM方法，用于客观且可扩展的教学质量评估，展示了其在人类水平和超人类水平上的性能，并与学生学习相关的教师增值测量对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教学质量的客观且可扩展的测量一直是教育领域的挑战，现有通用LLM难以可靠地应用于复杂的课堂观察工具。

Method: 使用基于句子嵌入的定制LLM架构，系统评估五种句子嵌入，设计数据高效的训练方案以防止过拟合。

Result: 定制模型在人类评分相关性上超过0.65，甚至超过人际评分一致性，且高级模型更多地关注课程级特征而非单句标注。

Conclusion: 研究为AI驱动的教学测量提供了新方法，展示了其在提供可扩展、可靠且有效反馈方面的潜力，但仍在个体项目级别上存在泛化不足的问题。

Abstract: Objective and scalable measurement of teaching quality is a persistent
challenge in education. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential,
general-purpose models have struggled to reliably apply complex, authentic
classroom observation instruments. This paper uses custom LLMs built on
sentence-level embeddings, an architecture better suited for the long-form,
interpretive nature of classroom transcripts than conventional subword
tokenization. We systematically evaluate five different sentence embeddings
under a data-efficient training regime designed to prevent overfitting. Our
results demonstrate that these specialized models can achieve human-level and
even super-human performance with expert human ratings above 0.65 and
surpassing the average human-human rater correlation. Further, through analysis
of annotation context windows, we find that more advanced models-those better
aligned with human judgments-attribute a larger share of score variation to
lesson-level features rather than isolated utterances, challenging the
sufficiency of single-turn annotation paradigms. Finally, to assess external
validity, we find that aggregate model scores align with teacher value-added
measures, indicating they are capturing features relevant to student learning.
However, this trend does not hold at the individual item level, suggesting that
while the models learn useful signals, they have not yet achieved full
generalization. This work establishes a viable and powerful new methodology for
AI-driven instructional measurement, offering a path toward providing scalable,
reliable, and valid feedback for educator development.

Motivation: 探讨不同架构的LLM在ICL任务中的表现差异及其内部机制，以更全面地理解模型能力。

Method: 结合行为探测和干预方法，评估了transformer、状态空间和混合模型在两类基于知识的ICL任务中的表现。

Result: 发现ICL的功能向量主要位于自注意力层和Mamba层，且Mamba2可能使用不同于功能向量的机制执行ICL。功能向量对涉及参数知识检索的ICL更重要。

Conclusion: 研究强调了结合行为和机制分析的重要性，为不同架构和任务类型的理解提供了更细致的视角。

Abstract: We perform in-depth evaluations of in-context learning (ICL) on
state-of-the-art transformer, state-space, and hybrid large language models
over two categories of knowledge-based ICL tasks. Using a combination of
behavioral probing and intervention-based methods, we have discovered that,
while LLMs of different architectures can behave similarly in task performance,
their internals could remain different. We discover that function vectors (FVs)
responsible for ICL are primarily located in the self-attention and Mamba
layers, and speculate that Mamba2 uses a different mechanism from FVs to
perform ICL. FVs are more important for ICL involving parametric knowledge
retrieval, but not for contextual knowledge understanding. Our work contributes
to a more nuanced understanding across architectures and task types.
Methodologically, our approach also highlights the importance of combining both
behavioural and mechanistic analyses to investigate LLM capabilities.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used as judges to evaluate response
quality, providing a scalable alternative to human evaluation. However, most
LLM judges operate solely on intrinsic text-based reasoning, limiting their
ability to verify complex constraints or perform accurate computation.
Motivated by the success of tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) in numerous tasks,
we propose TIR-Judge, an end-to-end RL framework for training LLM judges that
integrates a code executor for precise evaluation. TIR-Judge is built on three
principles: (i) diverse training across verifiable and non-verifiable domains,
(ii) flexible judgment formats (pointwise, pairwise, listwise), and (iii)
iterative RL that bootstraps directly from the initial model without
distillation. On seven public benchmarks, TIR-Judge surpasses strong
reasoning-based judges by up to 6.4% (pointwise) and 7.7% (pairwise), and
achieves listwise performance comparable to Claude-Opus-4 despite having only
8B parameters. Remarkably, TIR-Judge-Zero - trained entirely without distilled
judge trajectories, matches the performance of distilled variants,
demonstrating that tool-augmented judges can self-evolve through iterative
reinforcement learning.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multi-head attention (MHA) has become the cornerstone of modern large
language models, enhancing representational capacity through parallel attention
heads. However, increasing the number of heads inherently weakens individual
head capacity, and existing attention mechanisms - whether standard MHA or its
variants like grouped-query attention (GQA) and grouped-tied attention (GTA) -
simply concatenate outputs from isolated heads without strong interaction. To
address this limitation, we propose knocking-heads attention (KHA), which
enables attention heads to "knock" on each other - facilitating cross-head
feature-level interactions before the scaled dot-product attention. This is
achieved by applying a shared, diagonally-initialized projection matrix across
all heads. The diagonal initialization preserves head-specific specialization
at the start of training while allowing the model to progressively learn
integrated cross-head representations. KHA adds only minimal parameters and
FLOPs and can be seamlessly integrated into MHA, GQA, GTA, and other attention
variants. We validate KHA by training a 6.1B parameter MoE model (1.01B
activated) on 1T high-quality tokens. Compared to baseline attention
mechanisms, KHA brings superior and more stable training dynamics, achieving
better performance across downstream tasks.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Multilingual Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) often retrieves English
documents and translates them into the query language for low-resource
settings. However, poor translation quality degrades response generation
performance. Existing approaches either assume sufficient translation quality
or utilize the rewriting method, which introduces factual distortion and
hallucinations. To mitigate these problems, we propose Quality-Aware
Translation Tagging in mRAG (QTT-RAG), which explicitly evaluates translation
quality along three dimensions-semantic equivalence, grammatical accuracy, and
naturalness&fluency-and attach these scores as metadata without altering the
original content. We evaluate QTT-RAG against CrossRAG and DKM-RAG as baselines
in two open-domain QA benchmarks (XORQA, MKQA) using six instruction-tuned LLMs
ranging from 2.4B to 14B parameters, covering two low-resource languages
(Korean and Finnish) and one high-resource language (Chinese). QTT-RAG
outperforms the baselines by preserving factual integrity while enabling
generator models to make informed decisions based on translation reliability.
This approach allows for effective usage of cross-lingual documents in
low-resource settings with limited native language documents, offering a
practical and robust solution across multilingual domains.

encompass data curation, training strategies, and model architecture
optimization. We analyze mainstream model implementations in the context of
objective-driven interventions, illustrating how mid-training serves as a
distinct and critical stage in the progressive development of LLM capabilities.
By clarifying the unique contributions of mid-training, this survey offers a
comprehensive taxonomy and actionable insights, supporting future research and

Motivation: 现有方法在处理时间序列数据时忽视了其独特的统计特性和时间依赖性，导致效果不佳，因此需要一种新框架来解决这一问题。

Method: MAP4TS框架设计了四个专用提示组件（全局领域提示、局部领域提示、统计提示和时间提示），结合原始时间序列嵌入，并通过跨模态对齐模块生成统一表示，最后由LLM处理并进行预测。

Result: 在八个不同数据集上的实验表明，MAP4TS显著优于现有的基于LLM的方法，并且提示感知设计提高了性能稳定性，GPT-2骨干模型在结构化提示下优于更大的LLaMA模型。

Conclusion: MAP4TS通过结合经典时间序列分析和多提示设计，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能，展示了提示感知设计的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances have investigated the use of pretrained large language models
(LLMs) for time-series forecasting by aligning numerical inputs with LLM
embedding spaces. However, existing multimodal approaches often overlook the
distinct statistical properties and temporal dependencies that are fundamental
to time-series data. To bridge this gap, we propose MAP4TS, a novel
Multi-Aspect Prompting Framework that explicitly incorporates classical
time-series analysis into the prompt design. Our framework introduces four
specialized prompt components: a Global Domain Prompt that conveys
dataset-level context, a Local Domain Prompt that encodes recent trends and
series-specific behaviors, and a pair of Statistical and Temporal Prompts that
embed handcrafted insights derived from autocorrelation (ACF), partial
autocorrelation (PACF), and Fourier analysis. Multi-Aspect Prompts are combined
with raw time-series embeddings and passed through a cross-modality alignment
module to produce unified representations, which are then processed by an LLM
and projected for final forecasting. Extensive experiments across eight diverse
datasets show that MAP4TS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based
methods. Our ablation studies further reveal that prompt-aware designs
significantly enhance performance stability and that GPT-2 backbones, when
paired with structured prompts, outperform larger models like LLaMA in
long-term forecasting tasks.

Method: 研究了两种分层组织方式，并在三种大型语言模型上进行了综合评估，包括自动化指标、模型指标和领域专家评估。

Result: 分层方法通常能保持信息的事实性、覆盖范围和一致性，同时提升人类对摘要的偏好。GPT-4的模拟判断与人类判断在客观评价方面一致性较高。

Conclusion: 分层结构可以提升医学摘要的清晰度，同时保持内容覆盖范围，是提高生成摘要人类偏好的实用方法。

Abstract: Medical multi-document summarization (MDS) is a complex task that requires
effectively managing cross-document relationships. This paper investigates
whether incorporating hierarchical structures in the inputs of MDS can improve
a model's ability to organize and contextualize information across documents
compared to traditional flat summarization methods. We investigate two ways of
incorporating hierarchical organization across three large language models
(LLMs), and conduct comprehensive evaluations of the resulting summaries using
automated metrics, model-based metrics, and domain expert evaluation of
preference, understandability, clarity, complexity, relevance, coverage,
factuality, and coherence. Our results show that human experts prefer
model-generated summaries over human-written summaries. Hierarchical approaches
generally preserve factuality, coverage, and coherence of information, while
also increasing human preference for summaries. Additionally, we examine
whether simulated judgments from GPT-4 align with human judgments, finding
higher agreement along more objective evaluation facets. Our findings
demonstrate that hierarchical structures can improve the clarity of medical
summaries generated by models while maintaining content coverage, providing a
practical way to improve human preference for generated summaries.

Conclusion: 多语言建模在词形变化任务中高效且实用，简化了部署流程。

Abstract: We present a compact, single-model approach to multilingual inflection, the
task of generating inflected word forms from base lemmas to express grammatical
categories. Our model, trained jointly on data from 73 languages, is
lightweight, robust to unseen words, and outperforms monolingual baselines in
most languages. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multilingual modeling
for inflection and highlights its practical benefits: simplifying deployment by
eliminating the need to manage and retrain dozens of separate monolingual
models. In addition to the standard SIGMORPHON shared task benchmarks, we
evaluate our monolingual and multilingual models on 73 Universal Dependencies
(UD) treebanks, extracting lemma-tag-form triples and their frequency counts.
To ensure realistic data splits, we introduce a novel frequency-weighted,
lemma-disjoint train-dev-test resampling procedure. Our work addresses the lack
of an open-source, general-purpose, multilingual morphological inflection
system capable of handling unseen words across a wide range of languages,
including Czech. All code is publicly released at:

Motivation: 标准LoRA中所有输入令牌共享相同权重，限制了其对令牌特异性信息的捕捉能力。

Method: 提出TopLoRA，动态根据输入令牌调整LoRA权重，学习令牌级别的输入输出投影，权重表达为BΣ_XA。

Result: 在多个模型和数据集上的实验表明，TopLoRA一致优于LoRA及其变体。

Conclusion: TopLoRA通过令牌级别的适应，提升了模型性能且未增加LoRA权重秩。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method
widely used in large language models (LLMs). LoRA essentially describes the
projection of an input space into a low-dimensional output space, with the
dimensionality determined by the LoRA rank. In standard LoRA, all input tokens
share the same weights and undergo an identical input-output projection. This
limits LoRA's ability to capture token-specific information due to the inherent
semantic differences among tokens. To address this limitation, we propose
Token-wise Projected Low-Rank Adaptation (TopLoRA), which dynamically adjusts
LoRA weights according to the input token, thereby learning token-wise
input-output projections in an end-to-end manner. Formally, the weights of
TopLoRA can be expressed as $B\Sigma_X A$, where $A$ and $B$ are low-rank
matrices (as in standard LoRA), and $\Sigma_X$ is a diagonal matrix generated
from each input token $X$. Notably, TopLoRA does not increase the rank of LoRA
weights but achieves more granular adaptation by learning token-wise LoRA
weights (i.e., token-wise input-output projections). Extensive experiments
across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that TopLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants. The code is available at

Motivation: 传统形态学变形方法忽略了词频分布，而在实际应用中，用户输入往往反映真实世界的词频分布，因此需要改进以适应未来部署需求。

Method: 研究提出了三种频率信息的整合方法：(i) 训练-开发-测试分割时结合词频加权策略；(ii) 评估时结合类型准确率和词频加权准确率；(iii) 训练数据采样时引入频率感知方法。

Result: 频率感知训练在43种语言中的26种表现优于均匀采样。

Conclusion: 通过频率信息的整合，模型更接近真实世界的词频分布，提升了性能。

Abstract: The traditional approach to morphological inflection (the task of modifying a
base word (lemma) to express grammatical categories) has been, for decades, to
consider lexical entries of lemma-tag-form triples uniformly, lacking any
information about their frequency distribution. However, in production
deployment, one might expect the user inputs to reflect a real-world
distribution of frequencies in natural texts. With future deployment in mind,
we explore the incorporation of corpus frequency information into the task of
morphological inflection along three key dimensions during system development:
(i) for train-dev-test split, we combine a lemma-disjoint approach, which
evaluates the model's generalization capabilities, with a frequency-weighted
strategy to better reflect the realistic distribution of items across different
frequency bands in training and test sets; (ii) for evaluation, we complement
the standard type accuracy (often referred to simply as accuracy), which treats
all items equally regardless of frequency, with token accuracy, which assigns
greater weight to frequent words and better approximates performance on running
text; (iii) for training data sampling, we introduce a method novel in the
context of inflection, frequency-aware training, which explicitly incorporates
word frequency into the sampling process. We show that frequency-aware training
outperforms uniform sampling in 26 out of 43 languages.

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) adapts pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
to domain-specific instructions by training on a carefully curated subset of
high-quality instruction-response pairs, typically drawn from a larger dataset
that often contains many low-quality or noisy samples. However, existing
quality-first paradigms often overlook valuable signals in discarded
low-quality data and rely on imperfect quality filters. We introduce ENTP
(Enhancing low-quality SFT data via Neural-symbolic Text Purge-Mix), a
framework that revitalizes low-quality corpora through symbolic purification
and neural reconstruction. The symbolic module identifies and prunes noisy
samples based on statistical priors, while the neural component synthesizes
enriched instruction-response pairs by leveraging latent representations and
model knowledge. This neural-symbolic synergy enhances data informativeness and
diversity. Experiments show that ENTP-augmented datasets, constructed
exclusively from low-quality data, outperform 13 established data-selection
baselines across five instruction-following benchmarks, and even surpass
fine-tuning on the full original dataset (approximately 300K examples). Our
results highlight the untapped potential of low-quality data and underscore the
importance of intelligent purification and synthesis for efficient instruction
alignment.

Abstract: The screenplay serves as the foundation for television production, defining
narrative structure, character development, and dialogue. While Large Language
Models (LLMs) show great potential in creative writing, direct end-to-end
generation approaches often fail to produce well-crafted screenplays. We argue
this failure stems from forcing a single model to simultaneously master two
disparate capabilities: creative narrative construction and rigid format
adherence. The resulting outputs may mimic superficial style but lack the deep
structural integrity and storytelling substance required for professional use.
To enable LLMs to generate high-quality screenplays, we introduce Dual-Stage
Refinement (DSR), a decomposed framework that decouples creative narrative
generation from format conversion. The first stage transforms a brief outline
into rich, novel-style prose. The second stage refines this narrative into a
professionally formatted screenplay. This separation enables the model to
specialize in one distinct capability at each stage. A key challenge in
implementing DSR is the scarcity of paired outline-to-novel training data. We
address this through hybrid data synthesis: reverse synthesis deconstructs
existing screenplays into structured inputs, while forward synthesis leverages
these inputs to generate high-quality narrative texts as training targets.
Blind evaluations by professional screenwriters show that DSR achieves a 75%
win rate against strong baselines like Gemini-2.5-Pro and reaches 82.7% of
human-level performance. Our work demonstrates that decomposed generation
architecture with tailored data synthesis effectively specializes LLMs in
complex creative domains.

Abstract: AI-based code generation is increasingly prevalent, with GitHub Copilot
estimated to generate 46% of the code on GitHub. Accurately evaluating how well
generated code aligns with developer intent remains a critical challenge.
Traditional evaluation methods, such as unit tests, are often unscalable and
costly. Syntactic similarity metrics (e.g., BLEU, ROUGE) fail to capture code
functionality, and metrics like CodeBERTScore require reference code, which is
not always available. To address the gap in reference-free evaluation, with few
alternatives such as ICE-Score, this paper introduces MATCH, a novel
reference-free metric. MATCH uses Contrastive Learning to generate meaningful
embeddings for code and natural language task descriptions, enabling similarity
scoring that reflects how well generated code implements the task. We show that
MATCH achieves stronger correlations with functional correctness and human
preference than existing metrics across multiple programming languages.

compared to other approaches that typically require expert knowledge. However,
to the best of our knowledge, there are limited datasets specifically designed
for drug drug relation extraction currently available. Therefore, employing
transfer learning becomes necessary to apply machine learning methods in this
domain. In this study, we propose DREAM, a method that first employs a trained
relation extraction model to discover relations between entities and then
applies this model to a corpus of medical texts to construct an ontology of
drug relationships. The extracted relations are subsequently validated using a
large language model. Quantitative results indicate that the LLM agreed with 71
of the relations extracted from a subset of PubMed abstracts. Furthermore, our
qualitative analysis indicates that this approach can uncover ambiguities in
the medical domain, highlighting the challenges inherent in relation extraction
in this field.

### [252] [Process Reward Models for Sentence-Level Verification of LVLM Radiology Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23217)
*Alois Thomas,Maya Varma,Jean-Benoit Delbrouck,Curtis P. Langlotz*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 介绍了一种句子级别的过程奖励模型（PRM），用于检测大型视觉语言模型生成的放射学报告中的临床关键幻觉，表现出强泛化能力和实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有幻觉检测方法在句子级别粒度和跨模型泛化能力上的不足，以减少临床风险。

Method: 开发了一个轻量级的0.5B参数PRM，通过弱监督标签在MIMIC-CXR上微调，预测生成句子的事实正确性。

Result: PRM在多个指标上优于现有方法，如Matthews相关系数提高7.5%，AUROC提高1.8%，并能显著提升报告质量（F1-CheXbert提高4.5%）。

Conclusion: 轻量级且上下文感知的PRM为临床LVLM提供了一种模型无关的安全层，无需依赖内部激活状态。

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation with Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs) holds great potential, yet these models often produce clinically
critical hallucinations, posing serious risks. Existing hallucination detection
methods frequently lack the necessary sentence-level granularity or robust
generalization across different LVLM generators. We introduce a novel approach:
a sentence-level Process Reward Model (PRM) adapted for this vision-language
task. Our PRM predicts the factual correctness of each generated sentence,
conditioned on clinical context and preceding text. When fine-tuned on
MIMIC-CXR with weakly-supervised labels, a lightweight 0.5B-parameter PRM
outperforms existing verification techniques, demonstrating, for instance,
relative improvements of 7.5% in Matthews Correlation Coefficient and 1.8% in
AUROC over strong white-box baselines on outputs from one LVLM. Unlike methods
reliant on internal model states, our PRM demonstrates strong generalization to
an unseen LVLM. We further show its practical utility: PRM scores effectively
filter low-quality reports, improving F1-CheXbert scores by 4.5% (when
discarding the worst 10% of reports). Moreover, when guiding a novel weighted
best-of-N selection process on the MIMIC-CXR test set, our PRM show relative
improvements in clinical metrics of 7.4% for F1-CheXbert and 0.6% for
BERTScore. These results demonstrate that a lightweight, context-aware PRM
provides a model-agnostic safety layer for clinical LVLMs without access to
internal activations

TL;DR: 论文研究了方言变化对自动语音识别（ASR）的影响，开发了一个78小时的孟加拉语语音转文本（STT）数据集Ben-10，发现基础模型在方言ASR任务中表现不佳，但方言特定的模型训练能缓解问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究方言变化对ASR的影响，特别是低资源语言中方言识别的挑战。

Method: 开发Ben-10数据集，从语言学和数据驱动的角度分析基础模型在方言ASR中的表现，并尝试方言特定的模型训练。

Result: 基础模型在方言识别任务中表现不佳，但方言特定训练能改善效果；Ben-10可作为低资源ASR模型的OOD资源。

Conclusion: 方言变化对ASR模型构成挑战，方言特定训练是可行的解决方案；Ben-10数据集为低资源ASR研究提供了支持。

Abstract: Conventional research on speech recognition modeling relies on the canonical
form for most low-resource languages while automatic speech recognition (ASR)
for regional dialects is treated as a fine-tuning task. To investigate the
effects of dialectal variations on ASR we develop a 78-hour annotated Bengali
Speech-to-Text (STT) corpus named Ben-10. Investigation from linguistic and
data-driven perspectives shows that speech foundation models struggle heavily
in regional dialect ASR, both in zero-shot and fine-tuned settings. We observe
that all deep learning methods struggle to model speech data under dialectal
variations but dialect specific model training alleviates the issue. Our
dataset also serves as a out of-distribution (OOD) resource for ASR modeling
under constrained resources in ASR algorithms. The dataset and code developed
for this project are publicly available

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: Mubeen是一个专有的阿拉伯语言模型，专注于阿拉伯语言学、伊斯兰研究和文化遗产的深度学习，采用原生阿拉伯语源确保文化真实性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统阿拉伯语模型依赖英语翻译数据导致意图检测和检索增强生成（RAG）失败的问题，同时填补‘实用性鸿沟危机’。

Method: 模型基于原生阿拉伯语源训练，结合深度语言工程框架和实践闭包架构（Practical Closure Architecture）。

Result: Mubeen能够精确理解古典文本、当代写作和地区方言，并在文化保护和通用知识领域表现优异。

Conclusion: Mubeen不仅是一个信息库，还是一个明确的指导工具，与沙特2030愿景保持一致。

Abstract: Mubeen is a proprietary Arabic language model developed by MASARAT SA,
optimized for deep understanding of Arabic linguistics, Islamic studies, and
cultural heritage. Trained on an extensive collection of authentic Arabic
sources significantly expanded by digitizing historical manuscripts via a
proprietary Arabic OCR engine, the model incorporates seminal scholarly works
in linguistics, jurisprudence, hadith, and Quranic exegesis, alongside
thousands of academic theses and peer-reviewed research papers. Conditioned
through a deep linguistic engineering framework, Mubeen masters not just the
meaning but the eloquence of Arabic, enabling precise understanding across
classical texts, contemporary writing, and regional dialects with focus on
comprehending user intent and delivering accurate, contextually relevant
responses. Unlike other Arabic models relying on translated English data that
often fail in intent detection or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), Mubeen
uses native Arabic sources to ensure cultural authenticity and accuracy. Its
core innovation is the Practical Closure Architecture, designed to solve the
"Utility Gap Crisis" where factually correct answers fail to resolve users'
core needs, forcing them into frustrating cycles of re-prompting. By
prioritizing clarity and decisive guidance, Mubeen transforms from an
information repository into a decisive guide, aligning with Saudi Vision 2030.
The model's architecture combines deep heritage specialization with
multi-disciplinary expert modules, enabling robust performance across both
cultural preservation and general knowledge domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在代码相关任务中表现优异，但在视觉导向任务中美学质量不足。

Method: 构建AesCode-358K数据集，提出多智能体奖励反馈机制，开发GRPO-AR算法和OpenDesign基准。

Result: AesCoder-4B超越GPT-4o和GPT-4.1，性能接近大型开源模型。

Conclusion: 结合监督微调和强化学习显著提升代码美学质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have become valuable assistants for developers
in code-related tasks. While LLMs excel at traditional programming tasks such
as code generation and bug fixing, they struggle with visually-oriented coding
tasks, often producing suboptimal aesthetics. In this paper, we introduce a new
pipeline to enhance the aesthetic quality of LLM-generated code. We first
construct AesCode-358K, a large-scale instruction-tuning dataset focused on
code aesthetics. Next, we propose agentic reward feedback, a multi-agent system
that evaluates executability, static aesthetics, and interactive aesthetics.
Building on this, we develop GRPO-AR, which integrates these signals into the
GRPO algorithm for joint optimization of functionality and code aesthetics.
Finally, we develop OpenDesign, a benchmark for assessing code aesthetics.
Experimental results show that combining supervised fine-tuning on AesCode-358K
with reinforcement learning using agentic reward feedback significantly
improves performance on OpenDesign and also enhances results on existing
benchmarks such as PandasPlotBench. Notably, our AesCoder-4B surpasses GPT-4o
and GPT-4.1, and achieves performance comparable to large open-source models
with 480B-685B parameters, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 任务的目标是解决自然多派对谈中的极端语音重叠问题（高达100%），通过多模态方法提高识别效果，弥补纯音频基线的不足。

Method: 利用音频、视觉和上下文线索联合转录每位发言者的语音，并将其聚类到各自的对话中。数据采集聚焦于无脚本的群体聊天场景。

Result: 实验表明，纯音频基线的词错误率超过100%，而加入视觉线索后性能提升50%，证明了多模态方法的重要性。

Conclusion: MCoRec任务通过多模态数据显著提升了对重叠对话的识别能力，为后续研究提供了重要基线。

Abstract: We introduce the task of Multi-Modal Context-Aware Recognition (MCoRec) in
the ninth CHiME Challenge, which addresses the cocktail-party problem of
overlapping conversations in a single-room setting using audio, visual, and
contextual cues. MCoRec captures natural multi-party conversations where the
recordings focus on unscripted, casual group chats, leading to extreme speech
overlap of up to 100% and highly fragmented conversational turns. The task
requires systems to answer the question "Who speaks when, what, and with whom?"
by jointly transcribing each speaker's speech and clustering them into their
respective conversations from audio-visual recordings. Audio-only baselines
exceed 100% word error rate, whereas incorporating visual cues yields
substantial 50% improvements, highlighting the importance of multi-modality. In
this manuscript, we present the motivation behind the task, outline the data
collection process, and report the baseline systems developed for the MCoRec.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Arabic Little STT数据集，填补了阿拉伯语儿童语音数据的空白，并评估了Whisper模型在该数据集上的表现，结果显示模型在儿童语音识别上的性能显著低于成人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决低资源语言（如阿拉伯语）和儿童语音数据的稀缺问题，推动公平语音技术的发展。

Method: 创建Arabic Little STT数据集（355条儿童语音），并系统性评估Whisper模型的八个变体在该数据集上的表现。

Result: Whisper模型（Large_v3）在儿童语音上的词错误率（WER）为0.66，远高于成人数据集的0.20以下，揭示了儿童语音识别的挑战。

Conclusion: 需要专门的儿童语音基准测试和包容性训练数据，同时强调数据必须遵守严格的伦理和隐私框架。公开数据集有望推动阿拉伯语儿童语音技术的发展。

Abstract: The performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems fundamentally depends
on high-quality training data. However, low-resource languages like Arabic
suffer from severe data scarcity. Moreover, the absence of child-specific
speech corpora is an essential gap that poses significant challenges. To
address this gap, we present our created dataset, Arabic Little STT, a dataset
of Levantine Arabic child speech recorded in classrooms, containing 355
utterances from 288 children (ages 6 - 13). We further conduct a systematic
assessment of Whisper, a state-of-the-art automatic speech recognition (ASR)
model, on this dataset and compare its performance with adult Arabic
benchmarks. Our evaluation across eight Whisper variants reveals that even the
best-performing model (Large_v3) struggles significantly, achieving a 0.66 word
error rate (WER) on child speech, starkly contrasting with its sub 0.20 WER on
adult datasets. These results align with other research on English speech.
Results highlight the critical need for dedicated child speech benchmarks and
inclusive training data in ASR development. Emphasizing that such data must be
governed by strict ethical and privacy frameworks to protect sensitive child
information. We hope that this study provides an initial step for future work
on equitable speech technologies for Arabic-speaking children. We hope that our
publicly available dataset enrich the children's demographic representation in
ASR datasets.

TL;DR: AdaSearch是一种新颖的分块搜索策略，通过自适应分配计算预算，专注于生成初始关键令牌，显著提升LLM对齐任务的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM对齐仍是一个关键挑战，传统推理方法的计算资源分配不够灵活。研究表明，响应中的初始令牌对对齐任务尤为关键。

Method: 提出AdaSearch分块搜索策略及其树搜索版本AdaBeam，通过采样计划自适应分配固定计算预算，集中于关键令牌的搜索。

Result: 在8种LLM上的评估显示，AdaSearch在无害性生成、情感控制和数学推理任务中优于Best-of-N和微调基线，胜率提升超10%。

Conclusion: AdaSearch通过优化计算资源分配显著提升了LLM对齐任务的性能，为推理时间对齐提供了一种高效解决方案。

Abstract: LLM alignment remains a critical challenge. Inference-time methods provide a
flexible alternative to fine-tuning, but their uniform computational effort
often yields suboptimal alignment. We hypothesize that for many alignment
tasks, the initial tokens of a response are disproportionately more critical.
To leverage this principle, we introduce AdaSearch, a novel blockwise search
strategy. It adaptively allocates a fixed computational budget using a sampling
schedule, focusing search effort on these critical tokens. We apply AdaSearch
to sequential decoding and introduce its tree-search counterpart, AdaBeam. Our
comprehensive evaluation across eight LLMs demonstrates that AdaSearch
outperforms strong Best-of-N and fine-tuning baselines. Specifically, win-rates
improve by over 10% for harmlessness generation, controlled sentiment
generation, and for mathematical reasoning tasks relative to Best-of-N.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于八字推理的QA数据集和BaZi-LLM系统，结合符号推理与大型语言模型，显著提升了虚拟角色生成的准确性和文化相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前虚拟角色生成方法依赖大量标注数据或手工设计的人物提示，难以扩展且难以生成真实、上下文一致的角色。

Method: 创建了基于八字推理的QA数据集，并提出BaZi-LLM系统，结合符号推理与大型语言模型生成动态、细粒度的虚拟角色。

Result: 相较于主流LLM（如DeepSeek-v3和GPT-5-mini），该方法在准确性上提升了30.3%-62.6%；若使用错误的八字信息，准确性下降20%-45%。

Conclusion: 研究展示了结合文化基础的符号推理与LLM在虚拟角色模拟中的潜力，为生成更具真实感的虚拟角色提供了新思路。

Abstract: Human-like virtual characters are crucial for games, storytelling, and
virtual reality, yet current methods rely heavily on annotated data or
handcrafted persona prompts, making it difficult to scale up and generate
realistic, contextually coherent personas. We create the first QA dataset for
BaZi-based persona reasoning, where real human experiences categorized into
wealth, health, kinship, career, and relationships are represented as
life-event questions and answers. Furthermore, we propose the first BaZi-LLM
system that integrates symbolic reasoning with large language models to
generate temporally dynamic and fine-grained virtual personas. Compared with
mainstream LLMs such as DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-5-mini, our method achieves a
30.3%-62.6% accuracy improvement. In addition, when incorrect BaZi information
is used, our model's accuracy drops by 20%-45%, showing the potential of
culturally grounded symbolic-LLM integration for realistic character
simulation.

Motivation: 高质量知识图谱稀缺是下游AI应用的关键瓶颈，现有方法依赖错误率高的模式匹配或资源密集型大语言模型，缺乏低资源环境下的可访问性。

Method: LightKGG通过两项技术实现高效知识图谱提取：（1）上下文集成图提取，将上下文与节点和边统一整合；（2）拓扑增强关系推断，利用图结构推断关系。

Result: 该方法在低硬件需求下实现了精确的知识图谱构建，填补了自动化知识提取与实用部署间的差距。

Conclusion: LightKGG为解决知识图谱提取中的资源限制问题提供了科学严谨的方法，为结构化NLP任务中的SLM效率优化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality knowledge graphs (KGs) remains a critical
bottleneck for downstream AI applications, as existing extraction methods rely
heavily on error-prone pattern-matching techniques or resource-intensive large
language models (LLMs). While recent tools leverage LLMs to generate KGs, their
computational demands limit accessibility for low-resource environments. Our
paper introduces LightKGG, a novel framework that enables efficient KG
extraction from textual data using small-scale language models (SLMs) through
two key technical innovations: (1) Context-integrated Graph extraction
integrates contextual information with nodes and edges into a unified graph
structure, reducing the reliance on complex semantic processing while
maintaining more key information; (2) Topology-enhanced relationship inference
leverages the inherent topology of the extracted graph to efficiently infer
relationships, enabling relationship discovery without relying on complex
language understanding capabilities of LLMs. By enabling accurate KG
construction with minimal hardware requirements, this work bridges the gap
between automated knowledge extraction and practical deployment scenarios while
introducing scientifically rigorous methods for optimizing SLM efficiency in
structured NLP tasks.

Method: 结合基于规则的层次树模型和零样本设置下的大语言模型（LLMs），分析了88万句以上的文本数据集。

Result: 规则方法比LLMs标记更多句子为宗教语言，揭示了方法学差异及宗教语言定义（词汇vs.上下文）的争议。

Conclusion: 研究表明数字化方法在宗教语言分析中具有潜力与局限性，突显了语境对定义宗教语言的重要性。

Abstract: Religious language continues to permeate contemporary discourse, even in
ostensibly secular domains such as environmental activism and climate change
debates. This paper investigates how explicit and implicit forms of religious
language appear in climate-related texts produced by secular and religious
nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). We introduce a dual methodological
approach: a rule-based model using a hierarchical tree of religious terms
derived from ecotheology literature, and large language models (LLMs) operating
in a zero-shot setting. Using a dataset of more than 880,000 sentences, we
compare how these methods detect religious language and analyze points of
agreement and divergence. The results show that the rule-based method
consistently labels more sentences as religious than LLMs. These findings
highlight not only the methodological challenges of computationally detecting
religious language but also the broader tension over whether religious language
should be defined by vocabulary alone or by contextual meaning. This study
contributes to digital methods in religious studies by demonstrating both the
potential and the limitations of approaches for analyzing how the sacred
persists in climate discourse.

Conclusion: Omni-Reward为解决多模态奖励建模的挑战提供了有效方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) play a critical role in aligning AI behaviors with human
preferences, yet they face two fundamental challenges: (1) Modality Imbalance,
where most RMs are mainly focused on text and image modalities, offering
limited support for video, audio, and other modalities; and (2) Preference
Rigidity, where training on fixed binary preference pairs fails to capture the
complexity and diversity of personalized preferences. To address the above
challenges, we propose Omni-Reward, a step toward generalist omni-modal reward
modeling with support for free-form preferences, consisting of: (1) Evaluation:
We introduce Omni-RewardBench, the first omni-modal RM benchmark with free-form
preferences, covering nine tasks across five modalities including text, image,
video, audio, and 3D; (2) Data: We construct Omni-RewardData, a multimodal
preference dataset comprising 248K general preference pairs and 69K
instruction-tuning pairs for training generalist omni-modal RMs; (3) Model: We
propose Omni-RewardModel, which includes both discriminative and generative
RMs, and achieves strong performance on Omni-RewardBench as well as other
widely used reward modeling benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融叙事分析对投资者、审计师和监管机构至关重要，但由于文本长度、专业术语和微妙语言，细粒度分析具有挑战性。传统方法需要大量昂贵的标记数据。

Method: 构建了一个专注于债务、EPS和销售额的句子级语料库，利用ChatGPT-o3-pro模型标记立场（正向、负向、中性）。使用零样本、少样本和思维链提示策略评估LLMs的性能。

Result: 少样本思维链提示在监督基线中表现最佳，LLMs在SEC和ECT数据集上的性能有所差异，展示了其在金融领域中无需大量标记数据的实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究表明LLMs可以有效地用于金融领域的特定目标立场分析，减少了依赖大规模标记数据的需求。

Abstract: Financial narratives from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)
filing reports and quarterly earnings call transcripts (ECTs) are very
important for investors, auditors, and regulators. However, their length,
financial jargon, and nuanced language make fine-grained analysis difficult.
Prior sentiment analysis in the financial domain required a large, expensive
labeled dataset, making the sentence-level stance towards specific financial
targets challenging. In this work, we introduce a sentence-level corpus for
stance detection focused on three core financial metrics: debt, earnings per
share (EPS), and sales. The sentences were extracted from Form 10-K annual
reports and ECTs, and labeled for stance (positive, negative, neutral) using
the advanced ChatGPT-o3-pro model under rigorous human validation. Using this
corpus, we conduct a systematic evaluation of modern large language models
(LLMs) using zero-shot, few-shot, and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting
strategies. Our results show that few-shot with CoT prompting performs best
compared to supervised baselines, and LLMs' performance varies across the SEC
and ECT datasets. Our findings highlight the practical viability of leveraging
LLMs for target-specific stance in the financial domain without requiring
extensive labeled data.

TL;DR: MMTutorBench是首个专注于AI数学辅导的基准测试，包含685个围绕教育关键步骤的问题，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的辅导能力。研究发现，专有系统和开源系统存在性能差距，与人类导师相比仍有提升空间，且OCR流程会降低辅导质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）测试基准大多忽略了数学辅导中的关键技能，如诊断学生困难和分步指导。为了填补这一空白，研究团队开发了MMTutorBench，旨在评估和改进AI数学辅导能力。

Method: 研究团队构建了685个围绕教育关键步骤的问题，每个问题配有详细的评估标准（rubrics），涵盖六个维度。基准测试分为三个任务：Insight Discovery、Operation Formulation和Operation Execution。评估了12种领先的MLLMs，并分析了输入变体（如OCR流程和少样本提示）的影响。

Result: 评估结果显示，专有模型和开源模型之间存在明显性能差距，AI辅导与人类导师相比尚有很大提升空间。OCR流程会显著降低辅导质量，少样本提示效果有限，而基于rubrics的LLM-as-a-Judge评估方法被证明非常可靠。

Conclusion: MMTutorBench不仅揭示了当前AI数学辅导的局限性，还提供了诊断工具和改进方向，有助于推动AI辅导技术的发展。

Abstract: Effective math tutoring requires not only solving problems but also
diagnosing students' difficulties and guiding them step by step. While
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) show promise, existing benchmarks
largely overlook these tutoring skills. We introduce MMTutorBench, the first
benchmark for AI math tutoring, consisting of 685 problems built around
pedagogically significant key-steps. Each problem is paired with
problem-specific rubrics that enable fine-grained evaluation across six
dimensions, and structured into three tasks-Insight Discovery, Operation
Formulation, and Operation Execution. We evaluate 12 leading MLLMs and find
clear performance gaps between proprietary and open-source systems, substantial
room compared to human tutors, and consistent trends across input variants: OCR
pipelines degrade tutoring quality, few-shot prompting yields limited gains,
and our rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge proves highly reliable. These results
highlight both the difficulty and diagnostic value of MMTutorBench for
advancing AI tutoring.

Conclusion: M4FC是一个真实、多样化的数据集，推动了多模态事实核查研究的发展。

Abstract: Existing real-world datasets for multimodal automated fact-checking have
multiple limitations: they contain few instances, focus on only one or two
languages and tasks, suffer from evidence leakage, or depend on external sets
of news articles for sourcing true claims. To address these shortcomings, we
introduce M4FC, a new real-world dataset comprising 4,982 images paired with
6,980 claims. The images, verified by professional fact-checkers from 22
organizations, represent diverse cultural and geographic contexts. Each claim
is available in one or two out of ten languages. M4FC spans six multimodal
fact-checking tasks: visual claim extraction, claimant intent prediction, fake
detection, image contextualization, location verification, and verdict
prediction. We provide baseline results for all tasks and analyze how combining
intermediate tasks influence downstream verdict prediction performance. We make

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个名为IPQA的基准测试，用于评估个性化问答中的核心意图识别能力，填补了现有评测标准仅关注回答质量或检索性能而忽略意图识别的关键空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评测标准未能直接衡量意图识别能力，而理解用户的核心意图是生成满足个性化信息需求回答的基础。

Method: 通过从用户行为模式中推导核心意图（基于满意度理论），构建多领域数据集，并结合自动化验证与人工验证进行质量控制。

Result: 实验表明，现有语言模型在个性化情境下难以有效识别核心意图，且随着问题复杂性增加性能下降。

Conclusion: IPQA基准测试及其数据集将公开，以促进未来围绕核心意图识别的研究。

Abstract: Intent identification serves as the foundation for generating appropriate
responses in personalized question answering (PQA). However, existing
benchmarks evaluate only response quality or retrieval performance without
directly measuring intent identification capabilities. This gap is critical
because without understanding which intents users prioritize, systems cannot
generate responses satisfying individual information needs. To address this, we
introduce the concept of core intents: intents users prioritize when selecting
answers to satisfy their information needs. To evaluate these core intents, we
propose IPQA, a benchmark for core Intent identification in Personalized
Question Answering. Since users do not explicitly state their prioritized
intents, we derive core intents from observable behavior patterns in answer
selection, grounded in satisficing theory where users choose answers meeting
their acceptance thresholds. We construct a dataset with various domains
through systematic filtering, LLM-based annotation, and rigorous quality
control combining automated verification with human validation. Experimental
evaluations across state-of-the-art language models reveal that current systems
struggle with core intent identification in personalized contexts. Models fail
to identify core intents from user histories, with performance degrading as
question complexity increases. The code and dataset will be made publicly
available to facilitate future research in this direction.

### [267] [LimRank: Less is More for Reasoning-Intensive Information Reranking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23544)
*Tingyu Song,Yilun Zhao,Siyue Zhang,Chen Zhao,Arman Cohan*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: LIMRANK 通过高质量的小规模监督训练，结合合成数据生成工具 LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER，在信息重排任务中表现优异，仅需 5% 的传统训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖大规模微调的高计算成本问题，验证小规模高质量监督的有效性。

Method: 设计 LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER 生成多样性合成数据，并用其微调 LIMRANK 模型。

Result: LIMRANK 在两个挑战性基准测试中表现优异，并在下游任务中展现强泛化能力。

Conclusion: LIMRANK 方法高效且泛化能力强，为信息重排任务提供了一种低成本解决方案。

Abstract: Existing approaches typically rely on large-scale fine-tuning to adapt LLMs
for information reranking tasks, which is computationally expensive. In this
work, we demonstrate that modern LLMs can be effectively adapted using only
minimal, high-quality supervision. To enable this, we design
LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER, a reusable and open-source pipeline for generating
diverse, challenging, and realistic reranking examples. Using this synthetic
data, we fine-tune our reranker model, LIMRANK. We evaluate LIMRANK on two
challenging benchmarks, i.e., BRIGHT for reasoning-intensive retrieval and
FollowIR for instruction-following retrieval. Our experiments demonstrate that
LIMRANK achieves competitive performance, while being trained on less than 5%
of the data typically used in prior work. Further ablation studies demonstrate
the effectiveness of LIMRANK-SYNTHESIZER and the strong generalization
capabilities of LIMRANK across downstream tasks, including scientific
literature search and retrieval-augmented generation for knowledge-intensive
problem solving.

### [268] [Hope Speech Detection in Social Media English Corpora: Performance of Traditional and Transformer Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23585)
*Luis Ramos,Hiram Calvo,Olga Kolesnikova*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文研究了传统机器学习和微调Transformer模型在识希望语音任务中的表现，发现Transformer模型在精度和召回率上更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别社交媒体上的希望语音是一种重要的NLP任务，能够帮助检测具有动机和目标导向的行为表达。

Method: 作者评估了传统机器学习模型（如SVM、逻辑回归、朴素贝叶斯）和微调的Transformer模型在一个已划分的数据集（训练集、开发集、测试集）上的表现。

Result: Transformer模型表现最佳（加权F1为0.79），优于传统机器学习模型（最高宏F1为0.78），表明其在捕捉希望语音的细微语义上更具优势。

Conclusion: 尽管传统机器学习模型表现灵活，但Transformer模型在希望语音检测中具有更高的性能，尤其是在小数据集上可能表现更优。

Abstract: The identification of hope speech has become a promised NLP task, considering
the need to detect motivational expressions of agency and goal-directed
behaviour on social media platforms. This proposal evaluates traditional
machine learning models and fine-tuned transformers for a previously split hope
speech dataset as train, development and test set. On development test, a
linear-kernel SVM and logistic regression both reached a macro-F1 of 0.78; SVM
with RBF kernel reached 0.77, and Na\"ive Bayes hit 0.75. Transformer models
delivered better results, the best model achieved weighted precision of 0.82,
weighted recall of 0.80, weighted F1 of 0.79, macro F1 of 0.79, and 0.80
accuracy. These results suggest that while optimally configured traditional
machine learning models remain agile, transformer architectures detect some
subtle semantics of hope to achieve higher precision and recall in hope speech
detection, suggesting that larges transformers and LLMs could perform better in
small datasets.

*Yizhu Jiao,Jiaqi Zeng,Julien Veron Vialard,Oleksii Kuchaiev,Jiawei Han,Olivier Delalleau*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: BR-RM模型通过两轮思考策略改进奖励建模，减少判断扩散，提升对细微错误的敏感性，实验证明其在多种领域基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型（RMs）通常将多个质量维度压缩为单一标量，导致注意力分散和分析浅薄。BR-RM旨在通过两轮思考策略解决这一问题。

Method: BR-RM采用两轮策略：第一轮自适应分支选择关键维度并提出假设，第二轮针对性重新审视验证假设。使用GRPO风格的强化学习和严格的格式检查进行训练。

Result: BR-RM在三个具有挑战性的奖励建模基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BR-RM通过两轮思考策略有效减少判断扩散，提升模型对关键错误的敏感性，同时保持实用性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that
externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with
think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit
stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many
quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces
judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding
diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a
two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1
performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical
dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise,
evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a
targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters
most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn
traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making
the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting
all-at-oncescoringintofocused, second-lookreasoning,
BR-RMreducesjudgmentdiffusionandimproves sensitivity to subtle yet
consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental
results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on
three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains. The code
and the model will be released soon.
