In this paper, we\npropose IG-Pruning, a novel input-aware block-wise pruning method that\ndynamically selects layer masks at inference time.

Our\napproach first divides the queries of the training datasets into two groups at\nthe dataset level. One includes queries that require augmentation and the other\nincludes queries that do not. Then, we introduces a synthesis process that\ngenerates appropriate augmentations for queries that require them by leveraging\na powerful Multimodal LLM (MLLM). Next, we present adaptive query augmentation.\nThrough this step, M-Solomon can conduct query augmentation only when necessary\nby learning to generate synthetic augmentations with the prefix /augment for\nqueries that demand them and to generate the simple string /embed for others.\nExperimental results showed that M-Solomon not only surpassed the baseline\nwithout augmentation by a large margin but also outperformed the baseline that\nalways used augmentation, providing much faster embedding latency.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86M-Solomon\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5224\u65ad\u4f55\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5d4c\u5165\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u67e5\u8be2\u8fdb\u884c\u589e\u5f3a\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u9ad8\u5ef6\u8fdf\u4e14\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u67e5\u8be2\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u5229\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u3002", "method": "M-Solomon\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u7ec4\u3001\u5408\u6210\u589e\u5f3a\u5185\u5bb9\u53ca\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u6b65\u9aa4\uff0c\u4ec5\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u589e\u5f3a\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cM-Solomon\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u65e0\u589e\u5f3a\u548c\u5168\u589e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3002", "conclusion": "M-Solomon\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u67e5\u8be2\u589e\u5f3a\u5728\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5d4c\u5165\u3002"}}

The DVB uses a novel\nexperimental design with controlled confounding between deep values (e.g.,\nmoral principles) and shallow features (e.g., superficial attributes). In the\ntraining phase, we expose LLMs to human preference data with deliberately\ncorrelated deep and shallow features -- for instance, where a user consistently\nprefers (non-maleficence, formal language) options over (justice, informal\nlanguage) alternatives.

This\ngap arises from the uniqueness of the individual decision-making process,\nshaped by numerical attributes (e.g., cost, time) and linguistic influences\n(e.g., personal preferences and constraints). Developing upon Utility Theory\nand leveraging the textual-reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models\n(LLMs), this paper proposes an Adaptive Textual-symbolic Human-centric\nReasoning framework (ATHENA) to address the optimal information integration.\nATHENA uniquely integrates two stages: First, it discovers robust, group-level\nsymbolic utility functions via LLM-augmented symbolic discovery; Second, it\nimplements individual-level semantic adaptation, creating personalized semantic\ntemplates guided by the optimal utility to model personalized choices.\nValidated on real-world travel mode and vaccine choice tasks, ATHENA\nconsistently outperforms utility-based, machine learning, and other LLM-based\nmodels, lifting F1 score by at least 6.5% over the strongest cutting-edge\nmodels. Further, ablation studies confirm that both stages of ATHENA are\ncritical and complementary, as removing either clearly degrades overall\npredictive performance. By organically integrating symbolic utility modeling\nand semantic adaptation, ATHENA provides a new scheme for modeling\nhuman-centric decisions.

Prior work measured this behavior only with coarse\ndataset-level statistics, overlooking the influence of model's confidence in\nunimodal reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a new framework that decomposes\nmodality following into two fundamental factors: relative reasoning uncertainty\n(the case-specific confidence gap between unimodal predictions) and inherent\nmodality preference( a model's stable bias when uncertainties are balanced). To\nvalidate this framework, we construct a controllable dataset that\nsystematically varies the reasoning difficulty of visual and textual inputs.\nUsing entropy as a fine-grained uncertainty metric, we uncover a universal law:\nthe probability of following a modality decreases monotonically as its relative\nuncertainty increases. At the relative difficulty level where the model tends\nto follow both modalities with comparable probability what we call the balance\npoint, a practical indicator of the model's inherent preference. Unlike\ntraditional macro-level ratios, this measure offers a more principled and less\nconfounded way to characterize modality bias, disentangling it from unimodal\ncapabilities and dataset artifacts. Further, by probing layer-wise predictions,\nwe reveal the internal mechanism of oscillation: in ambiguous regions near the\nbalance point, models vacillate between modalities across layers, explaining\nexternally observed indecision.

However, their enormous size limits storage and processing\ncapabilities to a few well-resourced stakeholders. As a result, most\napplications rely on pre-trained LLMs, fine-tuned for specific tasks. However,\neven storing the fine-tuned versions of these models remains a significant\nchallenge due to the wide range of tasks they address. Recently, studies show\nthat fine-tuning these models primarily affects a small fraction of parameters,\nhighlighting the need for more efficient storage of fine-tuned models. This\npaper focuses on efficient storage of parameter updates in pre-trained models\nafter fine-tuning. To address this challenge, we leverage the observation that\nfine-tuning updates are both low-rank and sparse, which can be utilized for\nstorage efficiency. However, using only low-rank approximation or\nsparsification may discard critical singular components that enhance model\nexpressivity. We first observe that given the same memory budget, sparsified\nlow-rank approximations with larger ranks outperform standard low-rank\napproximations with smaller ranks. Building on this, we propose our method,\noptimal singular damage, that selectively sparsifies low-rank approximated\nupdates by leveraging the interleaved importance of singular vectors, ensuring\nthat the most impactful components are retained.

However, for open-ended tasks\nlacking ground-truth solutions (e.g., creative writing and instruction\nfollowing), existing studies typically regard them as non-reasoning scenarios,\nthereby overlooking the latent value of reasoning capabilities. This raises a\nkey question: Can strengthening reasoning improve performance in open-ended\ntasks? To address this, we explore the transfer of the RLVR paradigm to the\nopen domain. Yet, since RLVR fundamentally relies on verifiers that presuppose\nthe existence of standard answers, it cannot be directly applied to open-ended\ntasks. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Verifiable Multiple-Choice\nReformulation (VMR), a novel training strategy that restructures open-ended\ndata into verifiable multiple-choice formats, enabling effective training even\nin the absence of explicit ground truth. Experimental results on multiple\nbenchmarks validate the effectiveness of our method in improving LLM\nperformance on open-ended tasks. Notably, across eight open-ended benchmarks,\nour VMR-based training delivers an average gain of 5.99 points over the\nbaseline.

We propose a\ncollaborative maze-solving benchmark that (i) isolates collaborative\ncapabilities, (ii) modulates problem complexity, (iii) enables scalable\nautomated grading, and (iv) imposes no output-format constraints, preserving\necological plausibility. Using this framework, we evaluate 32 leading open- and\nclosed-source models in solo, homogeneous, and heterogeneous pairings. Our\nresults reveal a \"collaboration gap\": models that perform well solo often\ndegrade substantially when required to collaborate. Collaboration can break\ndown dramatically; for instance, small distilled models that solve mazes well\nalone may fail almost completely in certain pairings. We find that starting\nwith the stronger agent often improves outcomes, motivating a \"relay inference\"\napproach where the stronger agent leads before handing off to the weaker one,\nclosing much of the gap.

To get around the\nconstraint of limited data, we develop a probabilistic model of attack\ndynamics, optimize our attack hyperparameters using this simulation, and then\nshow that the results transfer to SHADE-Arena.
