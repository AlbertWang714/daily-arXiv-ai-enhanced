Result: 在对抗性扰动增强的数据集上达到96.5%的准确率，推理时间仅为175ms，支持本地或边缘设备部署。

Abstract: The increasing realism of AI-generated imagery poses challenges for verifying
visual authenticity. We present an explainable image authenticity detection
system that combines a lightweight convolutional classifier
("Faster-Than-Lies") with a Vision-Language Model (Qwen2-VL-7B) to classify,
localize, and explain artifacts in 32x32 images. Our model achieves 96.5%
accuracy on the extended CiFAKE dataset augmented with adversarial
perturbations and maintains an inference time of 175ms on 8-core CPUs, enabling
deployment on local or edge devices. Using autoencoder-based reconstruction
error maps, we generate artifact localization heatmaps, which enhance
interpretability for both humans and the VLM. We further categorize 70 visual
artifact types into eight semantic groups and demonstrate explainable text
generation for each detected anomaly. This work highlights the feasibility of
combining visual and linguistic reasoning for interpretable authenticity
detection in low-resolution imagery and outlines potential cross-domain
applications in forensics, industrial inspection, and social media moderation.

### [2] [CountFormer: A Transformer Framework for Learning Visual Repetition and Structure in Class-Agnostic Object Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23785)
*Md Tanvir Hossain,Akif Islam,Mohd Ruhul Ameen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CountFormer是一个基于Transformer的框架，通过学习识别重复性和结构一致性来实现类别无关的物体计数，性能接近最先进方法，尤其在复杂场景中表现优越。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有计数模型无法像人类一样通过视觉重复和结构关系计数，尤其是在物体形状复杂或重叠时表现不佳。

Method: 替换原有视觉编码器为自监督基础模型DINOv2，引入位置嵌入融合以保留几何关系，并通过轻量卷积解码器生成密度图。

Result: 在FSC-147数据集上表现优异，尤其在结构复杂或密集场景中准确性更高。

Conclusion: DINOv2等基础模型的集成使计数系统接近人类的结构感知能力，推动了通用且无需示例的计数范式。

Abstract: Humans can effortlessly count diverse objects by perceiving visual repetition
and structural relationships rather than relying on class identity. However,
most existing counting models fail to replicate this ability; they often
miscount when objects exhibit complex shapes, internal symmetry, or overlapping
components. In this work, we introduce CountFormer, a transformer-based
framework that learns to recognize repetition and structural coherence for
class-agnostic object counting. Built upon the CounTR architecture, our model
replaces its visual encoder with the self-supervised foundation model DINOv2,
which produces richer and spatially consistent feature representations. We
further incorporate positional embedding fusion to preserve geometric
relationships before decoding these features into density maps through a
lightweight convolutional decoder. Evaluated on the FSC-147 dataset, our model
achieves performance comparable to current state-of-the-art methods while
demonstrating superior accuracy on structurally intricate or densely packed
scenes. Our findings indicate that integrating foundation models such as DINOv2
enables counting systems to approach human-like structural perception,
advancing toward a truly general and exemplar-free counting paradigm.

### [3] [A geometric and deep learning reproducible pipeline for monitoring floating anthropogenic debris in urban rivers using in situ cameras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23798)
*Gauthier Grimmer,Romain Wenger,Clément Flint,Germain Forestier,Gilles Rixhon,Valentin Chardon*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用固定摄像机监测河流中漂浮垃圾的新方法，结合深度学习和几何模型，实现了垃圾数量和尺寸的量化监控。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 河流中漂浮的人为垃圾日益增多，对生态环境、水质及人类活动（如航运和娱乐）造成负面影响，急需一种有效的监控方法。

Method: 使用了固定原位摄像机和深度学习模型，结合几何模型估算垃圾的实际尺寸，并测试了不同环境和学习配置下的模型表现。

Result: 研究发现数据集构建协议（尤其是负样本和时间泄漏的处理）对模型性能至关重要，并证明了结合投影几何和回归校正的可行性。

Conclusion: 该方法为开发低成本、自动化的城市水域监控系统奠定了基础。

Abstract: The proliferation of floating anthropogenic debris in rivers has emerged as a
pressing environmental concern, exerting a detrimental influence on
biodiversity, water quality, and human activities such as navigation and
recreation. The present study proposes a novel methodological framework for the
monitoring the aforementioned waste, utilising fixed, in-situ cameras. This
study provides two key contributions: (i) the continuous quantification and
monitoring of floating debris using deep learning and (ii) the identification
of the most suitable deep learning model in terms of accuracy and inference
speed under complex environmental conditions. These models are tested in a
range of environmental conditions and learning configurations, including
experiments on biases related to data leakage. Furthermore, a geometric model
is implemented to estimate the actual size of detected objects from a 2D image.
This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of
the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the
dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of
negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage. In conclusion, the
feasibility of metric object estimation using projective geometry coupled with
regression corrections is demonstrated. This approach paves the way for the
development of robust, low-cost, automated monitoring systems for urban aquatic
environments.

### [4] [RareFlow: Physics-Aware Flow-Matching for Cross-Sensor Super-Resolution of Rare-Earth Features](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23816)
*Forouzan Fallah,Wenwen Li,Chia-Yu Hsu,Hyunho Lee,Yezhou Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RareFlow是一个针对遥感图像超分辨率（SR）的物理感知框架，通过双条件架构和多方面损失函数提升OOD条件下的鲁棒性，减少特征幻觉，并在盲评中接近地面真实图像的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超分辨率方法在OOD条件下（如多样传感器捕获的罕见地貌特征）可能产生视觉上合理但物理上不准确的结果。RareFlow旨在解决这一问题。

Method: RareFlow采用双条件架构：Gated ControlNet保持输入的几何保真度，文本提示提供语义指导；并通过多方面损失函数确保物理一致性。框架还通过随机前向传播量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在多传感器卫星图像的新基准测试中，RareFlow输出接近地面真实图像的效果，显著优于现有基线方法（FID降低近40%）。

Conclusion: RareFlow为数据稀缺的科学领域提供了高保真合成的鲁棒框架，并为严重领域偏移下的可控生成提供了新范例。

Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) for remote sensing imagery often fails under
out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions, such as rare geomorphic features captured
by diverse sensors, producing visually plausible but physically inaccurate
results. We present RareFlow, a physics-aware SR framework designed for OOD
robustness. RareFlow's core is a dual-conditioning architecture. A Gated
ControlNet preserves fine-grained geometric fidelity from the low-resolution
input, while textual prompts provide semantic guidance for synthesizing complex
features. To ensure physically sound outputs, we introduce a multifaceted loss
function that enforces both spectral and radiometric consistency with sensor
properties. Furthermore, the framework quantifies its own predictive
uncertainty by employing a stochastic forward pass approach; the resulting
output variance directly identifies unfamiliar inputs, mitigating feature
hallucination. We validate RareFlow on a new, curated benchmark of multi-sensor
satellite imagery. In blind evaluations, geophysical experts rated our model's
outputs as approaching the fidelity of ground truth imagery, significantly
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. This qualitative superiority is
corroborated by quantitative gains in perceptual metrics, including a nearly
40\% reduction in FID. RareFlow provides a robust framework for high-fidelity
synthesis in data-scarce scientific domains and offers a new paradigm for
controlled generation under severe domain shift.

### [5] [TRELLISWorld: Training-Free World Generation from Object Generators](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23880)
*Hanke Chen,Yuan Liu,Minchen Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的3D场景生成方法，通过重用通用的文本到3D对象扩散模型，将场景生成重新定义为多块去噪问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D场景生成方法通常局限于单对象生成、需要特定领域的训练或不支持360度视图。

Method: 采用模块化的3D区块生成方法，通过加权平均无缝融合重叠的3D区域，实现大规模连贯场景的可扩展合成。

Result: 该方法支持多样化的场景布局、高效生成和灵活编辑，继承了对象级先验的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 为通用语言驱动的3D场景构建提供了一个简单而强大的基础。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D scene generation holds promise for a wide range of
applications, from virtual prototyping to AR/VR and simulation. However,
existing methods are often constrained to single-object generation, require
domain-specific training, or lack support for full 360-degree viewability. In
this work, we present a training-free approach to 3D scene synthesis by
repurposing general-purpose text-to-3D object diffusion models as modular tile
generators. We reformulate scene generation as a multi-tile denoising problem,
where overlapping 3D regions are independently generated and seamlessly blended
via weighted averaging. This enables scalable synthesis of large, coherent
scenes while preserving local semantic control. Our method eliminates the need
for scene-level datasets or retraining, relies on minimal heuristics, and
inherits the generalization capabilities of object-level priors. We demonstrate
that our approach supports diverse scene layouts, efficient generation, and
flexible editing, establishing a simple yet powerful foundation for
general-purpose, language-driven 3D scene construction.

### [6] [Improving Visual Discriminability of CLIP for Training-Free Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23894)
*Jinxin Zhou,Jiachen Jiang,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Summary generation failed


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Motivation analysis unavailable

Method: Method extraction failed

Result: Result analysis unavailable

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Extending CLIP models to semantic segmentation remains challenging due to the
misalignment between their image-level pre-training objectives and the
pixel-level visual understanding required for dense prediction. While prior
efforts have achieved encouraging results by reorganizing the final layer and
features, they often inherit the global alignment bias of preceding layers,
leading to suboptimal segmentation performance. In this work, we propose
LHT-CLIP, a novel training-free framework that systematically exploits the
visual discriminability of CLIP across layer, head, and token levels. Through
comprehensive analysis, we reveal three key insights: (i) the final layers
primarily strengthen image-text alignment with sacrifice of visual
discriminability (e.g., last 3 layers in ViT-B/16 and 8 layers in ViT-L/14),
partly due to the emergence of anomalous tokens; (ii) a subset of attention
heads (e.g., 10 out of 144 in ViT-B/16) display consistently strong visual
discriminability across datasets; (iii) abnormal tokens display sparse and
consistent activation pattern compared to normal tokens. Based on these
findings, we propose three complementary techniques: semantic-spatial
reweighting, selective head enhancement, and abnormal token replacement to
effectively restore visual discriminability and improve segmentation
performance without any additional training, auxiliary pre-trained networks, or
extensive hyperparameter tuning. Extensive experiments on 8 common semantic
segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that LHT-CLIP achieves state-of-the-art
performance across diverse scenarios, highlighting its effectiveness and
practicality for real-world deployment.

### [7] [DynaStride: Dynamic Stride Windowing with MMCoT for Instructional Multi-Scene Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23907)
*Eddison Pham,Prisha Priyadarshini,Adrian Maliackel,Kanishk Bandi,Cristian Meo,Kevin Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DynaStride是一种无需手动场景分割的流水线方法，用于生成连贯的场景级视频字幕，通过自适应帧采样和多模态窗口技术优化字幕质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升教学视频的字幕质量，支持多模态推理和学习过程，避免字幕结构不清导致的混淆。

Method: 使用YouCookII数据集的自适应帧采样和多模态窗口技术，结合动态步长窗口选择算法生成动作-对象对，整合为场景级字幕。

Result: 在BLEU、METEOR等指标上优于基线模型，生成的字幕更具时间连贯性和信息量。

Conclusion: DynaStride为AI生成教学内容提供了一种有效方法，显著提升了字幕质量。

Abstract: Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by
requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By
aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports
procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for
skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may
lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the
video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a
pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual
scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride
performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key
transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought
process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused
using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances
temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates
visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption.
Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o,
demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and
semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses
further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally
coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving
AI-powered instructional content generation.

### [8] [TurboPortrait3D: Single-step diffusion-based fast portrait novel-view synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23929)
*Emily Kim,Julieta Martinez,Timur Bagautdinov,Jessica Hodgins*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TurboPortrait3D是一种低延迟的人像新视角合成方法，结合图像到3D模型和扩散模型的优势，提升视觉效果并保持3D一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像到3D模型在细节和身份保持上表现不佳，而扩散模型虽然图像质量高但不支持多视角一致性。TurboPortrait3D旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过前馈图像到虚拟人生成流程获得初始3D表示，再用单步扩散模型优化渲染。采用预训练和微调策略结合合成数据和真实图像。

Result: TurboPortrait3D在质量和效率上均优于当前最佳方法，支持低延迟的新视角合成。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了人像新视角合成的质量与一致性，同时保持高效运行。

Abstract: We introduce TurboPortrait3D: a method for low-latency novel-view synthesis
of human portraits. Our approach builds on the observation that existing
image-to-3D models for portrait generation, while capable of producing
renderable 3D representations, are prone to visual artifacts, often lack of
detail, and tend to fail at fully preserving the identity of the subject. On
the other hand, image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images,
but besides being computationally expensive, are not grounded in 3D and thus
are not directly capable of producing multi-view consistent outputs. In this
work, we demonstrate that image-space diffusion models can be used to
significantly enhance the quality of existing image-to-avatar methods, while
maintaining 3D-awareness and running with low-latency. Our method takes a
single frontal image of a subject as input, and applies a feedforward
image-to-avatar generation pipeline to obtain an initial 3D representation and
corresponding noisy renders. These noisy renders are then fed to a single-step
diffusion model which is conditioned on input image(s), and is specifically
trained to refine the renders in a multi-view consistent way. Moreover, we
introduce a novel effective training strategy that includes pre-training on a
large corpus of synthetic multi-view data, followed by fine-tuning on
high-quality real images. We demonstrate that our approach both qualitatively
and quantitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art for portrait novel-view
synthesis, while being efficient in time.

### [9] [PlanarGS: High-Fidelity Indoor 3D Gaussian Splatting Guided by Vision-Language Planar Priors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23930)
*Xirui Jin,Renbiao Jin,Boying Li,Danping Zou,Wenxian Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PlanarGS是一种基于3DGS的室内场景重建框架，通过引入语言提示平面先验和几何先验优化，解决了大低纹理区域的几何模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3DGS在大低纹理区域的室内场景中，因光度损失导致几何模糊，无法重建高保真3D表面。

Method: 设计了一个语言提示平面先验（LP3）管道，结合预训练视觉-语言分割模型和几何先验优化，增加了平面一致性和几何监督项。

Result: 在标准室内基准测试中，PlanarGS显著优于现有方法，重建了精确且详细的3D表面。

Conclusion: PlanarGS通过引入平面和几何先验，有效提升了室内场景的3D重建质量。

Abstract: Three-dimensional Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as an
efficient representation for novel-view synthesis, achieving impressive visual
quality. However, in scenes dominated by large and low-texture regions, common
in indoor environments, the photometric loss used to optimize 3DGS yields
ambiguous geometry and fails to recover high-fidelity 3D surfaces. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce PlanarGS, a 3DGS-based framework tailored for
indoor scene reconstruction. Specifically, we design a pipeline for
Language-Prompted Planar Priors (LP3) that employs a pretrained vision-language
segmentation model and refines its region proposals via cross-view fusion and
inspection with geometric priors. 3D Gaussians in our framework are optimized
with two additional terms: a planar prior supervision term that enforces planar
consistency, and a geometric prior supervision term that steers the Gaussians
toward the depth and normal cues. We have conducted extensive experiments on
standard indoor benchmarks. The results show that PlanarGS reconstructs
accurate and detailed 3D surfaces, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
methods by a large margin. Project page: https://planargs.github.io

### [10] [Adaptive Training of INRs via Pruning and Densification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23943)
*Diana Aldana,João Paulo Lima,Daniel Csillag,Daniel Perazzo,Haoan Feng,Luiz Velho,Tiago Novello*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AIRe是一种自适应训练方案，通过神经元剪枝和输入频率密集化优化隐式神经表示（INRs），实现模型大小与重构质量的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式和繁重的超参数优化来选择输入频率和架构，且难以管理参数冗余，AIRe旨在解决这一问题。

Method: AIRe使用神经元剪枝机制减少冗余，并通过输入频率密集化提升表示能力；具体包括目标权重衰减和结构化剪枝，以及密集化阶段扩展输入频率。

Result: 实验表明，AIRe在图像和SDF任务中减少了模型大小，同时保持或提高了重构质量。

Conclusion: AIRe通过自适应优化INR架构，有效解决了传统方法的挑战，并展示了更好的性能与效率平衡。

Abstract: Encoding input coordinates with sinusoidal functions into multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) has proven effective for implicit neural representations
(INRs) of low-dimensional signals, enabling the modeling of high-frequency
details. However, selecting appropriate input frequencies and architectures
while managing parameter redundancy remains an open challenge, often addressed
through heuristics and heavy hyperparameter optimization schemes. In this
paper, we introduce AIRe ($\textbf{A}$daptive $\textbf{I}$mplicit neural
$\textbf{Re}$presentation), an adaptive training scheme that refines the INR
architecture over the course of optimization. Our method uses a neuron pruning
mechanism to avoid redundancy and input frequency densification to improve
representation capacity, leading to an improved trade-off between network size
and reconstruction quality. For pruning, we first identify less-contributory
neurons and apply a targeted weight decay to transfer their information to the
remaining neurons, followed by structured pruning. Next, the densification
stage adds input frequencies to spectrum regions where the signal underfits,
expanding the representational basis. Through experiments on images and SDFs,
we show that AIRe reduces model size while preserving, or even improving,
reconstruction quality. Code and pretrained models will be released for public
use.

### [11] [Neural USD: An object-centric framework for iterative editing and control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23956)
*Alejandro Escontrela,Shrinu Kushagra,Sjoerd van Steenkiste,Yulia Rubanova,Aleksander Holynski,Kelsey Allen,Kevin Murphy,Thomas Kipf*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Neural USD的新框架，用于解决可控生成建模中精确迭代对象编辑的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在编辑生成图像时容易导致全局变化，因此需要一种能够实现精确对象编辑的解决方案。

Method: 受计算机图形学中的USD标准启发，提出Neural USD框架，以结构化、层次化的方式表示场景和对象，并结合微调方法解耦控制信号。

Result: 通过实验验证了Neural USD框架的设计，展示了其在迭代和增量工作流程中的应用潜力。

Conclusion: Neural USD为可控生成建模中的精确对象编辑提供了一种有效的新方法。

Abstract: Amazing progress has been made in controllable generative modeling,
especially over the last few years. However, some challenges remain. One of
them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods,
trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a
particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other
elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to
unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps
to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene
Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we
introduce the "Neural Universal Scene Descriptor" or Neural USD. In this
framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical
manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific
constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and
pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above
control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design
considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables
iterative and incremental workflows. More information at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SafeVision是一种新型图像护栏，结合类似人类的推理以提高适应性和透明度，通过多样化QA生成和训练策略增强学习效果，并在现有基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像护栏模型因预定义类别和缺乏语义推理而误分类，且难以适应新威胁，需高成本重新训练。

Method: SafeVision引入了数据收集与生成框架、遵循政策的训练流程、定制损失函数及多样QA生成与训练策略。

Result: SafeVision在VisionHarm-T和VisionHarm-C上分别超越GPT-4o 8.6%和15.5%，速度提升16倍以上。

Conclusion: SafeVision实现了全面、遵循政策且可解释的图像护栏，能动态适应新兴威胁。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of digital media, the need for efficient and
transparent safeguards against unsafe content is more critical than ever.
Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often
misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic
reasoning. Moreover, these models struggle to adapt to emerging threats,
requiring costly retraining for new threats. To address these limitations, we
introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like
reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates
an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following
training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA
generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision
dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating
the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and
explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks,
which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm,
a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party
(VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse
harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision
achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision
outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while
being over 16x faster. SafeVision sets a comprehensive, policy-following, and
explainable image guardrail with dynamic adaptation to emerging threats.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合链式思维（CoT）推理的框架，用于胸部X光片的分析，旨在通过透明、逐步的推理过程提升模型的可解释性和临床信任度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的视觉语言模型（VLMs）在医学图像分析中缺乏透明性，无法提供医生依赖的逐步推理。该研究旨在通过学习专家的推理过程（而不仅仅是结论），增强模型的解释能力和临床实用性。

Method: 研究方法包括高保真视觉编码和两阶段训练：基于推理风格的监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RL），后者通过可验证的奖励函数优化模型输出。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在异分布评估中实现了竞争力的多标签分类性能，同时提高了可解释性。专家研究表明，完整的推理轨迹提升了医生的信心，减少了报告时间，并支持错误审计。

Conclusion: 该框架在胸部X光片分析中实现了高解释性和准确性，为医疗影像任务中可信赖的人工智能提供了方向，同时发布了模型和代码支持社区进步。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown strong promise for medical image
analysis, but most remain opaque, offering predictions without the transparent,
stepwise reasoning clinicians rely on. We present a framework that brings
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning to chest X-ray interpretation. Inspired by
reasoning-first training paradigms, our approach is designed to learn how
experts reason, not just what they conclude, by aligning intermediate steps
with observable image evidence and radiology workflow. Beyond accuracy, the
explicit reasoning traces support clinical auditability: they reveal why a
conclusion was reached, which alternatives were considered, and where
uncertainty remains, enabling quality assurance, error analysis, and safer
human-AI collaboration.
  Our model couples high-fidelity visual encoding with a two-stage training
recipe: a reasoning-style supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by
reinforcement learning (RL) that uses verifiable rewards over a list of X-ray
abnormalities. The model outputs reasoning that mirrors radiologists systematic
thought process, uncertainty, and differential diagnosis. In
out-of-distribution evaluation, the approach achieves competitive multi-label
classification while improving interpretability. In a reader study with expert
radiologists, full reasoning traces increased confidence, supported error
auditing, and reduced time to finalize reports. We release code and the model
NV-Reason-CXR-3B to support community progress toward trustworthy, explainable
AI in chest radiography and other medical imaging tasks where reasoning quality
is as critical as prediction quality.

TL;DR: TeleEgo是一个用于评估以自我为中心AI助手的长时、流式、全模态基准数据集，涵盖多模态输入和长期记忆任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常孤立评估能力或缺乏真实流式场景，TeleEgo旨在提供更全面和现实的评估环境。

Method: 数据集包含超过14小时的同步视频、音频和文本数据，涵盖生活四个领域，并定义12个子任务评估记忆、理解和跨记忆推理能力。

Result: TeleEgo包含3,291个人工验证的QA项目，并提出实时准确性和记忆持久时间两个关键指标。

Conclusion: TeleEgo为实用AI助手的开发提供了全面且现实的评估基准。

Abstract: Egocentric AI assistants in real-world settings must process multi-modal
inputs (video, audio, text), respond in real time, and retain evolving
long-term memory. However, existing benchmarks typically evaluate these
abilities in isolation, lack realistic streaming scenarios, or support only
short-term tasks. We introduce \textbf{TeleEgo}, a long-duration, streaming,
omni-modal benchmark for evaluating egocentric AI assistants in realistic daily
contexts. The dataset features over 14 hours per participant of synchronized
egocentric video, audio, and text across four domains: work \& study, lifestyle
\& routines, social activities, and outings \& culture. All data is aligned on
a unified global timeline and includes high-quality visual narrations and
speech transcripts, curated through human refinement.TeleEgo defines 12
diagnostic subtasks across three core capabilities: Memory (recalling past
events), Understanding (interpreting the current moment), and Cross-Memory
Reasoning (linking distant events). It contains 3,291 human-verified QA items
spanning multiple question formats (single-choice, binary, multi-choice, and
open-ended), evaluated strictly in a streaming setting. We propose two key
metrics -- Real-Time Accuracy and Memory Persistence Time -- to jointly assess
correctness, temporal responsiveness, and long-term retention. TeleEgo provides
a realistic and comprehensive evaluation to advance the development of

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 糖尿病视网膜病变是全球视力丧失的主要原因，早期和准确检测可显著改善治疗效果。现有的深度学习方法因设备、人群和成像条件的差异而难以保持鲁棒性。

Method: 提出AdvBlur方法，集成对抗性模糊图像并使用双损失函数框架，以应对领域泛化问题。

Result: 在多数据集上的全面评估表明，该方法能有效减轻未见分布变化的影响，并在外部数据集上取得了与最先进方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: AdvBlur方法通过对抗训练和双损失函数显著提升了DR分类模型的泛化能力。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of vision loss worldwide, yet
early and accurate detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
While numerous Deep learning (DL) models have been developed to predict DR from
fundus images, many face challenges in maintaining robustness due to
distributional variations caused by differences in acquisition devices,
demographic disparities, and imaging conditions. This paper addresses this
critical limitation by proposing a novel DR classification approach, a method
called AdvBlur. Our method integrates adversarial blurred images into the
dataset and employs a dual-loss function framework to address domain
generalization. This approach effectively mitigates the impact of unseen
distributional variations, as evidenced by comprehensive evaluations across
multiple datasets. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments to explore
the effects of factors such as camera type, low-quality images, and dataset
size. Furthermore, we perform ablation studies on blurred images and the loss
function to ensure the validity of our choices. The experimental results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization DR models on
unseen external datasets.

Abstract: The automated analysis of the aortic vessel tree (AVT) from computed
tomography angiography (CTA) holds immense clinical potential, but its
development has been impeded by a lack of shared, high-quality data. We
launched the SEG.A. challenge to catalyze progress in this field by introducing
a large, publicly available, multi-institutional dataset for AVT segmentation.
The challenge benchmarked automated algorithms on a hidden test set, with
subsequent optional tasks in surface meshing for computational simulations. Our
findings reveal a clear convergence on deep learning methodologies, with 3D
U-Net architectures dominating the top submissions. A key result was that an
ensemble of the highest-ranking algorithms significantly outperformed
individual models, highlighting the benefits of model fusion. Performance was
strongly linked to algorithmic design, particularly the use of customized
post-processing steps, and the characteristics of the training data. This
initiative not only establishes a new performance benchmark but also provides a
lasting resource to drive future innovation toward robust, clinically

Motivation: 火星科学缺乏标准化的基准测试和评估框架，限制了基础模型的发展和应用。

Method: 引入了Mars-Bench，一个包含20个数据集的基准测试，涵盖关键地质特征，并使用预训练模型进行基线评估。

Result: 火星特有的基础模型可能优于通用领域的模型，推动了领域适应性预训练的进一步探索。

Conclusion: Mars-Bench旨在为火星科学的机器学习模型开发与比较提供标准化基础，相关数据和代码已公开。

Abstract: Foundation models have enabled rapid progress across many specialized domains
by leveraging large-scale pre-training on unlabeled data, demonstrating strong
generalization to a variety of downstream tasks. While such models have gained
significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to
Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has
been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic
evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized
evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation
models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the
first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range
of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench
comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object
detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders,
and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline
evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data,
and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest
that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain
counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training.
Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and
comparing machine learning models for Mars science. Our data, models, and code

TL;DR: APT是一个黑盒框架，利用大语言模型自动生成人类可读的对抗性后缀，以评估文本到图像模型的安全性漏洞，并通过双规避策略绕过过滤器和黑名单。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管文本到图像（T2I）模型快速发展，但其安全机制易受对抗性提示攻击。现有红队方法通常需要白盒访问且效率低下，同时生成的提示语义无意义且易被过滤。

Method: APT采用交替优化的管道：对抗性后缀优化与模型微调结合；同时引入双规避策略，通过困惑度评分和禁止词惩罚绕过过滤器。

Result: 实验证明APT生成的对抗性提示具有高性能和强鲁棒性，能有效绕过过滤器和黑名单，并在商业API中展现出色的零样本迁移能力。

Conclusion: APT提供了一种高效、人类可读且对抗性强的红队方法，揭示了商业T2I模型的潜在漏洞。

Abstract: Despite rapid advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models, their safety
mechanisms are vulnerable to adversarial prompts, which maliciously generate
unsafe images. Current red-teaming methods for proactively assessing such
vulnerabilities usually require white-box access to T2I models, and rely on
inefficient per-prompt optimization, as well as inevitably generate
semantically meaningless prompts easily blocked by filters. In this paper, we
propose APT (AutoPrompT), a black-box framework that leverages large language
models (LLMs) to automatically generate human-readable adversarial suffixes for
benign prompts. We first introduce an alternating optimization-finetuning
pipeline between adversarial suffix optimization and fine-tuning the LLM
utilizing the optimized suffix. Furthermore, we integrates a dual-evasion
strategy in optimization phase, enabling the bypass of both perplexity-based
filter and blacklist word filter: (1) we constrain the LLM generating
human-readable prompts through an auxiliary LLM perplexity scoring, which
starkly contrasts with prior token-level gibberish, and (2) we also introduce
banned-token penalties to suppress the explicit generation of banned-tokens in
blacklist. Extensive experiments demonstrate the excellent red-teaming
performance of our human-readable, filter-resistant adversarial prompts, as
well as superior zero-shot transferability which enables instant adaptation to
unseen prompts and exposes critical vulnerabilities even in commercial APIs
(e.g., Leonardo.Ai.).

Motivation: 解决当前两阶段稀疏调优方法忽略参数调整和高内存消耗的问题。

Method: 引入非线性核函数的低秩分解和自适应双层级稀疏分配机制，实现高效稀疏调优。

Result: 在分类、分割和生成任务中表现优异，内存减少31.1%-39.9%，Top-1准确率提升1.8%。

Conclusion: SNELLA实现了高效内存使用和卓越性能，为下游任务提供了更好的适应性。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) aims to adapt pre-trained vision
models to downstream tasks. Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves
remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to
downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current
methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by
gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during
fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located
weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which
results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the
optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to
overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates
the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two
low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by
introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the
resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates,
enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant
weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that
encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their
importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted
on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different
pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA
performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s.
90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA.
Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9%
across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M. Our source codes are

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: COLA是一种基于最优传输的框架，旨在解决CLIP模型在对抗性扰动下的特征对齐问题，通过恢复全局图像-文本对齐和局部结构一致性提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了CLIP模型中文本与图像特征之间的不对齐问题，尤其是在对抗性扰动下，这种不对齐会导致分类性能显著下降。COLA旨在解决这一问题。

Method: COLA通过两步实现：1）将对抗性图像嵌入投影到类文本特征生成的子空间中；2）通过最优传输进一步增强多视图图像和文本分布的对齐。

Result: 在14个零样本分类基准测试中，COLA显著提升性能，尤其是在ImageNet及其变体上平均提升6.7%的对抗攻击鲁棒性，同时在干净样本上保持高精度。

Conclusion: COLA是一种无需训练的训练无关框架，能有效解决CLIP模型的对抗性特征不对齐问题，显著提升其在对抗性环境下的分类性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP demonstrate strong generalization
in zero-shot classification but remain highly vulnerable to adversarial
perturbations. Existing methods primarily focus on adversarial fine-tuning or
prompt optimization; they often overlook the gaps in CLIP's encoded features,
which is shown as the text and image features lie far apart from each other.
This misalignment is significantly amplified under adversarial perturbations,
leading to severe degradation in classification performance. To address this
problem, we propose Cross-modality Alignment, dubbed COLA, an optimal
transport-based framework that explicitly addresses adversarial misalignment by
restoring both global image-text alignment and local structural consistency in
the feature space. (1) COLA first projects adversarial image embeddings onto a
subspace spanned by class text features, effectively filtering out non-semantic
distortions while preserving discriminative information. (2) It then models
images and texts as discrete distributions over multiple augmented views and
refines their alignment via OT, with the subspace projection seamlessly
integrated into the cost computation. This design ensures stable cross-modal
alignment even under adversarial conditions. COLA is training-free and
compatible with existing fine-tuned models. Extensive evaluations across 14
zero-shot classification benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of COLA,
especially with an average improvement of 6.7% on ImageNet and its variants
under PGD adversarial attacks, while maintaining high accuracy on clean
samples.

TL;DR: BOB是一种文本到图像（T2I）模型的微调策略，通过提取类无关属性并显式条件化，缓解过拟合并提升低样本细粒度分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为提升合成数据在细粒度分类中的有效性，同时避免过拟合并保持生成多样性。

Method: 提取类无关属性（如场景背景和对象姿态），微调时显式条件化这些属性，生成时将其边缘化。

Result: 在多模型、数据集上优于现有方法，如在Aircraft数据集上提升7.4%，18/24实验设置中表现最优。

Conclusion: BOB通过优化微调策略显著提升低样本细粒度分类性能，优于仅使用真实数据或现有合成数据方法。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models are increasingly used for synthetic dataset
generation, but generating effective synthetic training data for classification
remains challenging. Fine-tuning a T2I model with a few real examples can help
improve the quality of synthetic training data; however, it may also cause
overfitting and reduce diversity in the generated samples. We propose a
fine-tuning strategy BOB (BeyondOBjects) to mitigate these concerns for
fine-grained classification. Given a small set of real examples, we first
extract class-agnostic attributes such as scene background and object pose. We
then explicitly condition on these attributes during fine-tuning of the T2I
model and marginalize them out during generation. This design mitigates
overfitting, preserves the T2I model's generative prior, reduces estimation
errors, and further minimizes unintended inter-class associations. Extensive
experiments across multiple T2I models, backbones, and datasets show that our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in low-shot fine-grained
classification when augmented with synthetic data. Concretely, BOB outperforms
DataDream by 7.4% on the Aircraft dataset (from 50.0% to 57.4% when fine-tuning
a CLIP classifier with five real images augmented with 100 synthetic images).
In three of the four benchmarks, fine-tuning downstream models with 5 real
images augmented with BOB achieves better performance than fine-tuning with 10
real images. Collectively, BOB outperforms prior art in 18 of 24 experimental
settings, with 2+% accuracy improvements in 14 of these settings.

Result: OmniText在多种任务和指标上达到了最先进的性能，与其他文本修复方法相比表现出色，与专用方法相当。

Conclusion: OmniText是首个能够执行多样化文本图像处理任务的通用方法，为相关领域提供了重要工具和基准数据集。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion-based text synthesis have demonstrated
significant performance in inserting and editing text within images via
inpainting. However, despite the potential of text inpainting methods, three
key limitations hinder their applicability to broader Text Image Manipulation
(TIM) tasks: (i) the inability to remove text, (ii) the lack of control over
the style of rendered text, and (iii) a tendency to generate duplicated
letters. To address these challenges, we propose OmniText, a training-free
generalist capable of performing a wide range of TIM tasks. Specifically, we
investigate two key properties of cross- and self-attention mechanisms to
enable text removal and to provide control over both text styles and content.
Our findings reveal that text removal can be achieved by applying
self-attention inversion, which mitigates the model's tendency to focus on
surrounding text, thus reducing text hallucinations. Additionally, we
redistribute cross-attention, as increasing the probability of certain text
tokens reduces text hallucination. For controllable inpainting, we introduce
novel loss functions in a latent optimization framework: a cross-attention
content loss to improve text rendering accuracy and a self-attention style loss
to facilitate style customization. Furthermore, we present OmniText-Bench, a
benchmark dataset for evaluating diverse TIM tasks. It includes input images,
target text with masks, and style references, covering diverse applications
such as text removal, rescaling, repositioning, and insertion and editing with
various styles. Our OmniText framework is the first generalist method capable
of performing diverse TIM tasks. It achieves state-of-the-art performance
across multiple tasks and metrics compared to other text inpainting methods and
is comparable with specialist methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练模型的视觉表示通常侧重于下游任务的分类性，但其广泛应用对表示的可解释性提出了新要求。研究旨在探讨预训练表示是否能同时实现高可解释性和高分类性。

Method: 提出了一种称为Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS)的方法，通过评估信息损失和衡量可解释语义的比例来量化表示的可解释性。

Result: 研究发现，可解释性与分类性呈正相关关系，即分类性更高的表示具有更多可解释语义。这一发现支持通过最大化可解释性进一步提高分类性，并基于解释的预测精度损失更小。

Conclusion: 预训练视觉模型的表示可解释性和分类性可以统一提升，为实际应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the
classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for
pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation
interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained
representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability
simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation
interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable
semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations,
only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas
the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we
propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the
information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies
the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation
interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that
the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e.,
representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable
semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further
supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the
classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with
interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for
the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with
less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and
corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements
in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models. Codes
are available at https://github.com/ssfgunner/IIS.

TL;DR: 提出了统一异构知识蒸馏（UHKD）框架，利用频率域中的中间特征进行跨架构知识转移，显著提升了异构模型间的知识蒸馏效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异构模型间的架构多样性导致语义差异，现有知识蒸馏方法主要针对同构模型设计，在异构场景中效果有限，尤其是涉及中间特征时。

Method: UHKD框架通过傅里叶变换捕捉全局特征信息，使用特征变换模块（FTM）生成紧凑的频率域表征，并通过可学习的特征对齐模块（FAM）对齐学生特征。训练结合中间特征的均方误差和输出层的KL散度。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1K上分别取得了5.59%和0.83%的性能提升，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UHKD是一种有效统一异构表征并高效利用视觉知识的方法。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is an effective model compression technique that
transfers knowledge from a high-performance teacher to a lightweight student,
reducing cost while maintaining accuracy. In visual applications, where
large-scale image models are widely used, KD enables efficient deployment.
However, architectural diversity introduces semantic discrepancies that hinder
the use of intermediate representations. Most existing KD methods are designed
for homogeneous models and degrade in heterogeneous scenarios, especially when
intermediate features are involved. Prior studies mainly focus on the logits
space, making limited use of the semantic information in intermediate layers.
To address this limitation, Unified Heterogeneous Knowledge Distillation (UHKD)
is proposed as a framework that leverages intermediate features in the
frequency domain for cross-architecture transfer. Fourier transform is applied
to capture global feature information, alleviating representational
discrepancies between heterogeneous teacher-student pairs. A Feature
Transformation Module (FTM) produces compact frequency-domain representations
of teacher features, while a learnable Feature Alignment Module (FAM) projects
student features and aligns them via multi-level matching. Training is guided
by a joint objective combining mean squared error on intermediate features with
Kullback-Leibler divergence on logits. Experiments on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1K
demonstrate gains of 5.59% and 0.83% over the latest method, highlighting UHKD
as an effective approach for unifying heterogeneous representations and
enabling efficient utilization of visual knowledge

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成质量上表现出色，但高昂的迭代采样成本限制了其应用。现有训练无关的加速方法缺乏对降噪趋势的控制和模型特定误差容忍度的考虑，导致生成结果不一致。

Method: ETC框架包含两部分：1）基于降噪轨迹连续性的一致趋势预测器，将历史降噪模式投射到稳定方向以实现高效加速；2）模型特定误差容忍度搜索机制，通过识别过渡点动态调整修正阈值。

Result: 实验表明，ETC在FLUX基础上实现了2.65倍的加速，且一致性退化可忽略（SSIM分数仅下降0.074）。

Conclusion: ETC通过结合趋势一致性和误差容忍度动态调整，显著提升了扩散模型的采样效率，同时保持了生成的稳定性和一致性。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable generative quality but remain
bottlenecked by costly iterative sampling. Recent training-free methods
accelerate diffusion process by reusing model outputs. However, these methods
ignore denoising trends and lack error control for model-specific tolerance,
leading to trajectory deviations under multi-step reuse and exacerbating
inconsistencies in the generated results. To address these issues, we introduce
Error-aware Trend Consistency (ETC), a framework that (1) introduces a
consistent trend predictor that leverages the smooth continuity of diffusion
trajectories, projecting historical denoising patterns into stable future
directions and progressively distributing them across multiple approximation
steps to achieve acceleration without deviating; (2) proposes a model-specific
error tolerance search mechanism that derives corrective thresholds by
identifying transition points from volatile semantic planning to stable quality
refinement. Experiments show that ETC achieves a 2.65x acceleration over FLUX
with negligible (-0.074 SSIM score) degradation of consistency.

Abstract: Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle
with compositionality, often failing to render accurate object counts,
attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a
training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with
self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic
quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize
explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image
generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge
reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome
iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based
inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with
prompts compared to recent text-to-image models. The code are available at

comprehensive caption optimization framework tailored to the needs of T2V
models.We begin by analyzing caption content from a T2V perspective,
decomposing the essential elements required for video reconstruction into
multiple dimensions, and proposing a principled caption design methodology. To
support evaluation, we construct VC4VG-Bench, a new benchmark featuring
fine-grained, multi-dimensional, and necessity-graded metrics aligned with
T2V-specific requirements.Extensive T2V fine-tuning experiments demonstrate a
strong correlation between improved caption quality and video generation
performance, validating the effectiveness of our approach. We release all

Abstract: This technical report presents our solution for the RoboSense Challenge at
IROS 2025, which evaluates Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on autonomous driving
scene understanding across perception, prediction, planning, and corruption
detection tasks. We propose a systematic framework built on four core
components. First, a Mixture-of-Prompts router classifies questions and
dispatches them to task-specific expert prompts, eliminating interference
across diverse question types. Second, task-specific prompts embed explicit
coordinate systems, spatial reasoning rules, role-playing,
Chain-of-Thought/Tree-of-Thought reasoning, and few-shot examples tailored to
each task. Third, a visual assembly module composes multi-view images with
object crops, magenta markers, and adaptive historical frames based on question
requirements. Fourth, we configure model inference parameters (temperature,
top-p, message roles) per task to optimize output quality. Implemented on
Qwen2.5-VL-72B, our approach achieves 70.87% average accuracy on Phase-1 (clean
data) and 72.85% on Phase-2 (corrupted data), demonstrating that structured
prompting and spatial grounding substantially enhance VLM performance on
safety-critical autonomous driving tasks. Code and prompt are available at

Result: 在六个数据集上的实验表明，UAP-SAM2显著优于现有攻击方法。

Conclusion: UAP-SAM2是首个针对SAM2的高效通用对抗攻击方法，解决了跨提示攻击的关键挑战。

Abstract: Recent studies reveal the vulnerability of the image segmentation foundation
model SAM to adversarial examples. Its successor, SAM2, has attracted
significant attention due to its strong generalization capability in video
segmentation. However, its robustness remains unexplored, and it is unclear
whether existing attacks on SAM can be directly transferred to SAM2. In this
paper, we first analyze the performance gap of existing attacks between SAM and
SAM2 and highlight two key challenges arising from their architectural
differences: directional guidance from the prompt and semantic entanglement
across consecutive frames. To address these issues, we propose UAP-SAM2, the
first cross-prompt universal adversarial attack against SAM2 driven by dual
semantic deviation. For cross-prompt transferability, we begin by designing a
target-scanning strategy that divides each frame into k regions, each randomly
assigned a prompt, to reduce prompt dependency during optimization. For
effectiveness, we design a dual semantic deviation framework that optimizes a
UAP by distorting the semantics within the current frame and disrupting the
semantic consistency across consecutive frames. Extensive experiments on six
datasets across two segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed method for SAM2. The comparative results show that UAP-SAM2
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) attacks by a large margin.

Abstract: Accurate polyp and cardiac segmentation for early detection and treatment is
essential for the diagnosis and treatment planning of cancer-like diseases.
Traditional convolutional neural network (CNN) based models have represented
limited generalizability, robustness, and inability to handle uncertainty,
which affects the segmentation performance. To solve these problems, this paper
introduces CLFSeg, an encoder-decoder based framework that aggregates the
Fuzzy-Convolutional (FC) module leveraging convolutional layers and fuzzy
logic. This module enhances the segmentation performance by identifying local
and global features while minimizing the uncertainty, noise, and ambiguity in
boundary regions, ensuring computing efficiency. In order to handle class
imbalance problem while focusing on the areas of interest with tiny and
boundary regions, binary cross-entropy (BCE) with dice loss is incorporated.
Our proposed model exhibits exceptional performance on four publicly available
datasets, including CVC-ColonDB, CVC-ClinicDB, EtisLaribPolypDB, and ACDC.
Extensive experiments and visual studies show CLFSeg surpasses the existing
SOTA performance and focuses on relevant regions of interest in anatomical
structures. The proposed CLFSeg improves performance while ensuring computing
efficiency, which makes it a potential solution for real-world medical
diagnostic scenarios. Project page is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MC-SJD是一种无需训练、无损的并行解码框架，通过耦合方法加速自回归视觉生成，显著提升推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归（AR）建模在视觉生成中的应用因推理速度慢而受限，亟需一种高效的无损加速方法。

Method: 基于耦合的信息理论方法MC-SJD，最大化连续迭代中采样相同草稿标记的概率，仅需单行代码修改即可实现。

Result: MC-SJD在图像生成中加速约4.2倍，视频生成中加速约13.3倍，且输出质量无损。

Conclusion: MC-SJD显著提升了AR视觉生成的效率，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While autoregressive (AR) modeling has recently emerged as a new paradigm in
visual generation, its practical adoption is severely constrained by the slow
inference speed of per-token generation, which often requires thousands of
steps to produce a single sample. To address this challenge, we propose MC-SJD,
a training-free, lossless parallel decoding framework designed to accelerate AR
visual generation by extending the recently introduced Speculative Jacobi
Decoding (SJD). Although SJD shows strong potential for accelerating AR
generation, we demonstrate that token instability across iterations
significantly reduces the acceptance rate, a limitation that primarily arises
from the independent sampling process used during draft token generation. To
overcome this, we introduce MC-SJD, an information-theoretic approach based on
coupling, which substantially accelerates standard SJD by maximizing the
probability of sampling identical draft tokens across consecutive iterations,
all while preserving its lossless property. Remarkably, this method requires
only a single-line modification to the existing algorithm, yet achieves
substantial performance gains, delivering up to a ~4.2x acceleration in image
generation and ~13.3x acceleration in video generation compared to standard AR
decoding, without any degradation in output quality.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖推理时干预（如负引导或能量优化），可能导致分布偏移和视觉质量下降。

Method: 采用条件扩散模型和身份掩码学习方案，通过身份变分自编码器建模身份特征，双向潜在对齐提取非身份属性，并使用软门控融合。

Result: 实验表明ID	extsuperscript{2}Face在视觉质量、身份抑制和实用性保持上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ID	extsuperscript{2}Face通过结构化潜在空间和解耦学习，实现了高效且高质量的匿名化。

Abstract: Face anonymization aims to conceal identity information while preserving
non-identity attributes. Mainstream diffusion models rely on inference-time
interventions such as negative guidance or energy-based optimization, which are
applied post-training to suppress identity features. These interventions often
introduce distribution shifts and entangle identity with non-identity
attributes, degrading visual fidelity and data utility. To address this, we
propose \textbf{ID\textsuperscript{2}Face}, a training-centric anonymization
framework that removes the need for inference-time optimization. The rationale
of our method is to learn a structured latent space where identity and
non-identity information are explicitly disentangled, enabling direct and
controllable anonymization at inference. To this end, we design a conditional
diffusion model with an identity-masked learning scheme. An Identity-Decoupled
Latent Recomposer uses an Identity Variational Autoencoder to model identity
features, while non-identity attributes are extracted from same-identity pairs
and aligned through bidirectional latent alignment. An Identity-Guided Latent
Harmonizer then fuses these representations via soft-gating conditioned on
noisy feature prediction. The model is trained with a recomposition-based
reconstruction loss to enforce disentanglement. At inference, anonymization is
achieved by sampling a random identity vector from the learned identity space.
To further suppress identity leakage, we introduce an Orthogonal Identity
Mapping strategy that enforces orthogonality between sampled and source
identity vectors. Experiments demonstrate that ID\textsuperscript{2}Face
outperforms existing methods in visual quality, identity suppression, and
utility preservation.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）处理的视觉令牌数量庞大且冗余，现有剪枝方法仅基于注意力分数选择显著令牌，导致语义不完整。

Method: 提出SCOPE策略，结合令牌显着性和覆盖范围，定义令牌覆盖增益并通过迭代选择最高SCOPE评分的令牌。

Result: 在多个视觉语言理解基准测试中，SCOPE方法显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SCOPE方法通过优化令牌选择策略，有效减少了计算开销且保持了语义完整性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) typically process a large number of
visual tokens, leading to considerable computational overhead, even though many
of these tokens are redundant. Existing visual token pruning methods primarily
focus on selecting the most salient tokens based on attention scores, resulting
in the semantic incompleteness of the selected tokens. In this paper, we
propose a novel visual token pruning strategy, called
\textbf{S}aliency-\textbf{C}overage \textbf{O}riented token \textbf{P}runing
for \textbf{E}fficient MLLMs (SCOPE), to jointly model both the saliency and
coverage of the selected visual tokens to better preserve semantic
completeness. Specifically, we introduce a set-coverage for a given set of
selected tokens, computed based on the token relationships. We then define a
token-coverage gain for each unselected token, quantifying how much additional
coverage would be obtained by including it. By integrating the saliency score
into the token-coverage gain, we propose our SCOPE score and iteratively select
the token with the highest SCOPE score. We conduct extensive experiments on
multiple vision-language understanding benchmarks using the LLaVA-1.5 and
LLaVA-Next models. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms prior approaches. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 论文提出了一种新的序列建模方法，通过结合CrossGate和ColorShift，有效解决了图像阴影去除中的结构完整性和颜色一致性问题。

Abstract: Recent deep models for image shadow removal often rely on attention-based
architectures to capture long-range dependencies. However, their fixed
attention patterns tend to mix illumination cues from irrelevant regions,
leading to distorted structures and inconsistent colors. In this work, we
revisit shadow removal from a sequence modeling perspective and explore the use
of Mamba, a selective state space model that propagates global context through
directional state transitions. These transitions yield an efficient global
receptive field while preserving positional continuity. Despite its potential,
directly applying Mamba to image data is suboptimal, since it lacks awareness
of shadow-non-shadow semantics and remains susceptible to color interference
from nearby regions. To address these limitations, we propose CrossGate, a
directional modulation mechanism that injects shadow-aware similarity into
Mamba's input gate, allowing selective integration of relevant context along
transition axes. To further ensure appearance fidelity, we introduce ColorShift
regularization, a contrastive learning objective driven by global color
statistics. By synthesizing structured informative negatives, it guides the
model to suppress color contamination and achieve robust color restoration.
Together, these components adapt sequence modeling to the structural integrity
and chromatic consistency required for shadow removal. Extensive experiments on
public benchmarks demonstrate that DeshadowMamba achieves state-of-the-art
visual quality and strong quantitative performance.

Conclusion: 该方法在数据稀缺条件下表现优异，新数据集推动了少样本和零样本技术的发展。

Abstract: Synthetic image source attribution is a challenging task, especially in data
scarcity conditions requiring few-shot or zero-shot classification
capabilities. We present a new training-free one-shot attribution method based
on image resynthesis. A prompt describing the image under analysis is
generated, then it is used to resynthesize the image with all the candidate
sources. The image is attributed to the model which produced the resynthesis
closest to the original image in a proper feature space. We also introduce a
new dataset for synthetic image attribution consisting of face images from
commercial and open-source text-to-image generators. The dataset provides a
challenging attribution framework, useful for developing new attribution models
and testing their capabilities on different generative architectures. The
dataset structure allows to test approaches based on resynthesis and to compare
them to few-shot methods. Results from state-of-the-art few-shot approaches and
other baselines show that the proposed resynthesis method outperforms existing
techniques when only a few samples are available for training or fine-tuning.
The experiments also demonstrate that the new dataset is a challenging one and
represents a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating future few-shot
and zero-shot methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLMs在细粒度视觉感知方面存在瓶颈，监督微调和强化微调各有不足，需要新的方法来解决。

Method: 设计了ViPER框架，结合图像级和实例级重建与两阶段强化学习策略，形成闭环训练模式。

Result: Qwen-Viper系列在多项任务中平均提升1.7%，细粒度感知任务最高提升6.0%。

Conclusion: ViPER不仅提升了感知能力，还为生成与理解的互惠关系提供了实证，推动了VLMs的发展。

Abstract: The limited capacity for fine-grained visual perception presents a critical
bottleneck for Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in real-world applications.
Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the
limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises
general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual
reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel
two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine
progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a
self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative
evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically
integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage
reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training
paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of
perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the
Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive
benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception,
Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different
vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling
self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence
for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a
breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.

Conclusion: 提示学习是解决卫星和航空图像域差距的可扩展高效方案，为未来研究奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene
classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity
of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and
sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown
promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual
and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains
suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific
semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically
explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for
few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several
representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context
Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating
Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from
static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization,
multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically
regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these
prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with
hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features.
Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets,
including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt
learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios.
Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust
cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable
and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial
imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.

Abstract: Teacher-student frameworks have emerged as a leading approach in

strong correlation and unreliable knowledge transfer process between teacher

reliable student at each iteration to enhance dual-student collaboration and
prevent error reinforcement. We also introduce a strategy of Loss-Aware
Exponential Moving Average to dynamically ensure that the teacher absorbs
meaningful information from students, improving the quality of pseudo-labels.
Our plug-and-play framework is extensively evaluated on 3D medical image

Conclusion: 高性能研究管道可转化为便携、临床可用的工具。

Abstract: Deep learning frameworks such as nnU-Net achieve state-of-the-art performance
in brain lesion segmentation but remain difficult to deploy clinically due to
heavy dependencies and monolithic design. We introduce \textit{StrokeSeg}, a
modular and lightweight framework that translates research-grade stroke lesion
segmentation models into deployable applications. Preprocessing, inference, and
postprocessing are decoupled: preprocessing relies on the Anima toolbox with
BIDS-compliant outputs, and inference uses ONNX Runtime with \texttt{Float16}
quantisation, reducing model size by about 50\%. \textit{StrokeSeg} provides
both graphical and command-line interfaces and is distributed as Python scripts
and as a standalone Windows executable. On a held-out set of 300 sub-acute and
chronic stroke subjects, segmentation performance was equivalent to the
original PyTorch pipeline (Dice difference $<10^{-3}$), demonstrating that
high-performing research pipelines can be transformed into portable, clinically
usable tools.

Abstract: Medical images used to train machine learning models are often accompanied by
radiology reports containing rich expert annotations. However, relying on these
reports as inputs for clinical prediction requires the timely manual work of a
trained radiologist. This raises a natural question: when can radiology reports
be leveraged during training to improve image-only classification? Prior works
are limited to evaluating pre-trained image representations by fine-tuning them
to predict diagnostic labels, often extracted from reports, ignoring tasks with
labels that are weakly associated with the text. To address this gap, we
conduct a systematic study of how radiology reports can be used during both
pre-training and fine-tuning, across diagnostic and prognostic tasks (e.g.,
12-month readmission), and under varying training set sizes. Our findings
reveal that: (1) Leveraging reports during pre-training is beneficial for
downstream classification tasks where the label is well-represented in the
text; however, pre-training through explicit image-text alignment can be
detrimental in settings where it's not; (2) Fine-tuning with reports can lead
to significant improvements and even have a larger impact than the pre-training
method in certain settings. These results provide actionable insights into when
and how to leverage privileged text data to train medical image classifiers
while highlighting gaps in current research.

Motivation: 中风后MRI显示的病灶和结构变化是恢复和结果的生物标志物，但传统监督分割方法难以捕捉。

Method: 使用REFLECT模型，基于ATLAS和IXI数据训练，评估其检测异常的能力。

Result: 在IXI数据训练的模型表现出更高的病灶分割准确性（Dice=0.37）和对非病灶异常的敏感性（FROC=0.62）。

Conclusion: 健康解剖数据的训练能更好地建模正常变异，提高结构异常检测的广度和可靠性。

Abstract: Post-stroke MRI not only delineates focal lesions but also reveals secondary
structural changes, such as atrophy and ventricular enlargement. These
abnormalities, increasingly recognised as imaging biomarkers of recovery and
outcome, remain poorly captured by supervised segmentation methods. We evaluate
REFLECT, a flow-based generative model, for unsupervised detection of both
focal and non-lesional abnormalities in post-stroke patients. Using dual-expert
central-slice annotations on ATLAS data, performance was assessed at the object
level with Free-Response ROC analysis for anomaly maps. Two models were trained
on lesion-free slices from stroke patients (ATLAS) and on healthy controls
(IXI) to test the effect of training data. On ATLAS test subjects, the
IXI-trained model achieved higher lesion segmentation (Dice = 0.37 vs 0.27) and
improved sensitivity to non-lesional abnormalities (FROC = 0.62 vs 0.43).
Training on fully healthy anatomy improves the modelling of normal variability,
enabling broader and more reliable detection of structural abnormalities.

Conclusion: GenTrack在多目标跟踪中展现出卓越性能，未来工作将进一步优化其应用和扩展。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel multi-object tracking (MOT) method, dubbed
GenTrack, whose main contributions include: a hybrid tracking approach
employing both stochastic and deterministic manners to robustly handle unknown
and time-varying numbers of targets, particularly in maintaining target
identity (ID) consistency and managing nonlinear dynamics, leveraging particle
swarm optimization (PSO) with some proposed fitness measures to guide
stochastic particles toward their target distribution modes, enabling effective
tracking even with weak and noisy object detectors, integration of social
interactions among targets to enhance PSO-guided particles as well as improve
continuous updates of both strong (matched) and weak (unmatched) tracks,
thereby reducing ID switches and track loss, especially during occlusions, a
GenTrack-based redefined visual MOT baseline incorporating a comprehensive
state and observation model based on space consistency, appearance, detection
confidence, track penalties, and social scores for systematic and efficient
target updates, and the first-ever publicly available source-code reference
implementation with minimal dependencies, featuring three variants, including
GenTrack Basic, PSO, and PSO-Social, facilitating flexible reimplementation.
Experimental results have shown that GenTrack provides superior performance on
standard benchmarks and real-world scenarios compared to state-of-the-art
trackers, with integrated implementations of baselines for fair comparison.
Potential directions for future work are also discussed. The source-code
reference implementations of both the proposed method and compared-trackers are

Abstract: This paper proposes a visual multi-object tracking method that jointly
employs stochastic and deterministic mechanisms to ensure identifier
consistency for unknown and time-varying target numbers under nonlinear
dynamics. A stochastic particle filter addresses nonlinear dynamics and
non-Gaussian noise, with support from particle swarm optimization (PSO) to
guide particles toward state distribution modes and mitigate divergence through
proposed fitness measures incorporating motion consistency, appearance
similarity, and social-interaction cues with neighboring targets. Deterministic
association further enforces identifier consistency via a proposed cost matrix
incorporating spatial consistency between particles and current detections,
detection confidences, and track penalties. Subsequently, a novel scheme is
proposed for the smooth updating of target states while preserving their
identities, particularly for weak tracks during interactions with other targets
and prolonged occlusions. Moreover, velocity regression over past states
provides trend-seed velocities, enhancing particle sampling and state updates.
The proposed tracker is designed to operate flexibly for both pre-recorded
videos and camera live streams, where future frames are unavailable.
Experimental results confirm superior performance compared to state-of-the-art
trackers. The source-code reference implementations of both the proposed method
and compared-trackers are provided on GitHub:

Abstract: The sustainable management of the Qaraaoun Reservoir, the largest surface
water body in Lebanon located in the Bekaa Plain, depends on reliable
monitoring of its storage volume despite frequent sensor malfunctions and
limited maintenance capacity. This study introduces a sensor-free approach that
integrates open-source satellite imagery, advanced water-extent segmentation,
and machine learning to estimate the reservoir surface area and volume in near
real time. Sentinel-2 and Landsat images are processed, where surface water is
delineated using a newly proposed water segmentation index. A machine learning
model based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) is trained on a curated dataset
that includes water surface area, water level, and water volume calculations
using a reservoir bathymetry survey. The model is then able to estimate
reservoir volume relying solely on surface area extracted from satellite
imagery, without the need for ground measurements. Water segmentation using the
proposed index aligns with ground truth for more than 95 percent of the
shoreline. Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV yields an optimized SVR
performance with error under 1.5 percent of full reservoir capacity and
coefficients of determination exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate the
robustness and cost-effectiveness of the method, offering a practical solution
for continuous, sensor-independent monitoring of reservoir storage. The
proposed methodology can be replicated for other water bodies, and the
resulting 50 years of time-series data is valuable for research on climate
change and environmental patterns.

Abstract: Ensuring transparency and trust in artificial intelligence (AI) models is
essential, particularly as they are increasingly applied in safety-critical and
high-stakes domains. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a promising approach
to address this challenge, yet the rigorous evaluation of XAI methods remains
crucial for optimizing the trade-offs between model complexity, predictive
performance, and interpretability. While extensive progress has been achieved
in evaluating XAI techniques for classification tasks, evaluation strategies
tailored to semantic segmentation remain relatively underexplored. This work
introduces a comprehensive and systematic evaluation framework specifically
designed for assessing XAI in semantic segmentation, explicitly accounting for
both spatial and contextual task complexities. The framework employs
pixel-level evaluation strategies and carefully designed metrics to provide
fine-grained interpretability insights. Simulation results using recently
adapted class activation mapping (CAM)-based XAI schemes demonstrate the
efficiency, robustness, and reliability of the proposed methodology. These
findings contribute to advancing transparent, trustworthy, and accountable
semantic segmentation models.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has shown great promise for achieving high
rate-distortion performance. However, current LIC methods are often limited in
their capability to model the complex correlation structures inherent in
natural images, particularly the entanglement of invariant global structures
with transient local textures within a single monolithic representation. This
limitation precipitates severe geometric deformation at low bitrates. To
address this, we introduce a framework predicated on functional decomposition,
which we term Deeply-Conditioned Image Compression via self-generated priors
(DCIC-sgp). Our central idea is to first encode a potent, self-generated prior
to encapsulate the image's structural backbone. This prior is subsequently
utilized not as mere side-information, but to holistically modulate the entire
compression pipeline. This deep conditioning, most critically of the analysis
transform, liberates it to dedicate its representational capacity to the
residual, high-entropy details. This hierarchical, dependency-driven approach
achieves an effective disentanglement of information streams. Our extensive
experiments validate this assertion; visual analysis demonstrates that our
method substantially mitigates the geometric deformation artifacts that plague
conventional codecs at low bitrates. Quantitatively, our framework establishes
highly competitive performance, achieving significant BD-rate reductions of
14.4%, 15.7%, and 15.1% against the VVC test model VTM-12.1 on the Kodak, CLIC,
and Tecnick datasets.

Method: 通过在时空数据上预训练的VDMs，辅以轻量级适配器，设计多任务评估（如ARC-AGI、视觉游戏等）。

Result: VDMs在数据效率上优于语言模型，展现了其在视觉基础模型发展中的潜力。

Conclusion: 视频预训练为视觉基础模型的发展提供了有益的归纳偏置。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that large-scale pretraining
enables systems to adapt rapidly to new problems with little supervision in the
language domain. This success, however, has not translated as effectively to
the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with
compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose
problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising
direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows
these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we
hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a
controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are
equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural
modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games,
route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency
than their language counterparts. Taken together, our results indicate that
video pretraining offers inductive biases that support progress toward visual
foundation models.

Abstract: Markerless multiview motion capture is often constrained by the need for
precise camera calibration, limiting accessibility for non-experts and
in-the-wild captures. Existing calibration-free approaches mitigate this
requirement but suffer from high computational cost and reduced reconstruction
accuracy.
  We present Kineo, a fully automatic, calibration-free pipeline for markerless
motion capture from videos captured by unsynchronized, uncalibrated,
consumer-grade RGB cameras. Kineo leverages 2D keypoints from off-the-shelf
detectors to simultaneously calibrate cameras, including Brown-Conrady
distortion coefficients, and reconstruct 3D keypoints and dense scene point
maps at metric scale. A confidence-driven spatio-temporal keypoint sampling
strategy, combined with graph-based global optimization, ensures robust
calibration at a fixed computational cost independent of sequence length. We
further introduce a pairwise reprojection consensus score to quantify 3D
reconstruction reliability for downstream tasks.
  Evaluations on EgoHumans and Human3.6M demonstrate substantial improvements
over prior calibration-free methods. Compared to previous state-of-the-art
approaches, Kineo reduces camera translation error by approximately 83-85%,
camera angular error by 86-92%, and world mean-per-joint error (W-MPJPE) by
83-91%.
  Kineo is also efficient in real-world scenarios, processing multi-view
sequences faster than their duration in specific configuration (e.g., 36min to
process 1h20min of footage). The full pipeline and evaluation code are openly
released to promote reproducibility and practical adoption at

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Denoising generative models, such as diffusion and flow-based models, produce
high-quality samples but require many denoising steps due to discretization
error. Flow maps, which estimate the average velocity between timesteps,
mitigate this error and enable faster sampling. However, their training
typically demands architectural changes that limit compatibility with
pretrained flow models. We introduce Decoupled MeanFlow, a simple decoding
strategy that converts flow models into flow map models without architectural
modifications. Our method conditions the final blocks of diffusion transformers
on the subsequent timestep, allowing pretrained flow models to be directly
repurposed as flow maps. Combined with enhanced training techniques, this
design enables high-quality generation in as few as 1 to 4 steps. Notably, we
find that training flow models and subsequently converting them is more
efficient and effective than training flow maps from scratch. On ImageNet
256x256 and 512x512, our models attain 1-step FID of 2.16 and 2.12,
respectively, surpassing prior art by a large margin. Furthermore, we achieve
FID of 1.51 and 1.68 when increasing the steps to 4, which nearly matches the
performance of flow models while delivering over 100x faster inference.

Result: DisK-NeuralRTI能够在保持高质量的同时，显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 该方法为解决NeuralRTI的计算瓶颈提供了一种有效途径，适合在有限硬件上运行。

Abstract: Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) is very popular for its ability to
visually analyze surfaces by enhancing surface details through interactive
relighting, starting from only a few tens of photographs taken with a fixed
camera and variable illumination. Traditional methods like Polynomial Texture
Maps (PTM) and Hemispherical Harmonics (HSH) are compact and fast, but struggle
to accurately capture complex reflectance fields using few per-pixel
coefficients and fixed bases, leading to artifacts, especially in highly
reflective or shadowed areas. The NeuralRTI approach, which exploits a neural
autoencoder to learn a compact function that better approximates the local
reflectance as a function of light directions, has been shown to produce
superior quality at comparable storage cost. However, as it performs
interactive relighting with custom decoder networks with many parameters, the
rendering step is computationally expensive and not feasible at full resolution
for large images on limited hardware. Earlier attempts to reduce costs by
directly training smaller networks have failed to produce valid results. For
this reason, we propose to reduce its computational cost through a novel
solution based on Knowledge Distillation (DisK-NeuralRTI). ...

Abstract: While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding,
they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and
imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking
to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework
that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual
representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual
understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without
compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach
integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive
reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the
generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process
and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this,
we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively
produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these
into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset
MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad
delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone.
It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and
Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our
framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and
broader applications. More details and resources are available on our project

Abstract: Cone-beam CT (CBCT) employs a flat-panel detector to achieve
three-dimensional imaging with high spatial resolution. However, CBCT is
susceptible to scatter during data acquisition, which introduces CT value bias
and reduced tissue contrast in the reconstructed images, ultimately degrading
diagnostic accuracy. To address this issue, we propose a deep learning-based
scatter artifact correction method inspired by physical prior knowledge.
Leveraging the fact that the observed point scatter probability density
distribution exhibits rotational symmetry in the projection domain. The method
uses Gaussian Radial Basis Functions (RBF) to model the point scatter function
and embeds it into the Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) layer, which provides
efficient nonlinear mapping capabilities for learning high-dimensional scatter
features. By incorporating the physical characteristics of the scattered photon
distribution together with the complex function mapping capacity of KAN, the
model improves its ability to accurately represent scatter. The effectiveness
of the method is validated through both synthetic and real-scan experiments.
Experimental results show that the model can effectively correct the scatter
artifacts in the reconstructed images and is superior to the current methods in
terms of quantitative metrics.

Abstract: Recently, image editing based on Diffusion-in-Transformer models has
undergone rapid development. However, existing editing methods often lack
effective control over the degree of editing, limiting their ability to achieve
more customized results. To address this limitation, we investigate the
MM-Attention mechanism within the DiT model and observe that the Query and Key
tokens share a bias vector that is only layer-dependent. We interpret this bias
as representing the model's inherent editing behavior, while the delta between
each token and its corresponding bias encodes the content-specific editing
signals. Based on this insight, we propose Group Relative Attention Guidance, a
simple yet effective method that reweights the delta values of different tokens
to modulate the focus of the model on the input image relative to the editing
instruction, enabling continuous and fine-grained control over editing
intensity without any tuning. Extensive experiments conducted on existing image
editing frameworks demonstrate that GRAG can be integrated with as few as four
lines of code, consistently enhancing editing quality. Moreover, compared to
the commonly used Classifier-Free Guidance, GRAG achieves smoother and more
precise control over the degree of editing. Our code will be released at

Abstract: Video transitions aim to synthesize intermediate frames between two clips,
but naive approaches such as linear blending introduce artifacts that limit
professional use or break temporal coherence. Traditional techniques
(cross-fades, morphing, frame interpolation) and recent generative inbetweening
methods can produce high-quality plausible intermediates, but they struggle
with bridging diverse clips involving large temporal gaps or significant
semantic differences, leaving a gap for content-aware and visually coherent
transitions. We address this challenge by drawing on artistic workflows,
distilling strategies such as aligning silhouettes and interpolating salient
features to preserve structure and perceptual continuity. Building on this, we
propose SAGE (Structure-Aware Generative vidEo transitions) as a zeroshot
approach that combines structural guidance, provided via line maps and motion
flow, with generative synthesis, enabling smooth, semantically consistent
transitions without fine-tuning. Extensive experiments and comparison with
current alternatives, namely [FILM, TVG, DiffMorpher, VACE, GI], demonstrate
that SAGE outperforms both classical and generative baselines on quantitative
metrics and user studies for producing transitions between diverse clips. Code

Abstract: Infrastructure-based perception plays a crucial role in intelligent
transportation systems, offering global situational awareness and enabling
cooperative autonomy. However, existing camera-based detection models often
underperform in such scenarios due to challenges such as multi-view
infrastructure setup, diverse camera configurations, degraded visual inputs,
and various road layouts. We introduce MIC-BEV, a Transformer-based
bird's-eye-view (BEV) perception framework for infrastructure-based
multi-camera 3D object detection. MIC-BEV flexibly supports a variable number
of cameras with heterogeneous intrinsic and extrinsic parameters and
demonstrates strong robustness under sensor degradation. The proposed
graph-enhanced fusion module in MIC-BEV integrates multi-view image features
into the BEV space by exploiting geometric relationships between cameras and
BEV cells alongside latent visual cues. To support training and evaluation, we
introduce M2I, a synthetic dataset for infrastructure-based object detection,
featuring diverse camera configurations, road layouts, and environmental
conditions. Extensive experiments on both M2I and the real-world dataset
RoScenes demonstrate that MIC-BEV achieves state-of-the-art performance in 3D
object detection. It also remains robust under challenging conditions,
including extreme weather and sensor degradation. These results highlight the
potential of MIC-BEV for real-world deployment. The dataset and source code are

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that
collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human
cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object
representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in
memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While
prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention)
explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability
naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they
could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for
downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic
nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two
patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode
IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe,
which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability
emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker
in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial
architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining
objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a
low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal
actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations
degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective,
implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining
objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and
highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges
naturally in a connectionist system.

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling model
capacity while preserving computational efficiency. Despite its notable success
in large language models (LLMs), existing attempts to apply MoE to Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs) have yielded limited gains. We attribute this gap to
fundamental differences between language and visual tokens. Language tokens are
semantically dense with pronounced inter-token variation, while visual tokens
exhibit spatial redundancy and functional heterogeneity, hindering expert
specialization in vision MoE. To this end, we present ProMoE, an MoE framework
featuring a two-step router with explicit routing guidance that promotes expert
specialization. Specifically, this guidance encourages the router to partition
image tokens into conditional and unconditional sets via conditional routing
according to their functional roles, and refine the assignments of conditional
image tokens through prototypical routing with learnable prototypes based on
semantic content. Moreover, the similarity-based expert allocation in latent
space enabled by prototypical routing offers a natural mechanism for
incorporating explicit semantic guidance, and we validate that such guidance is
crucial for vision MoE. Building on this, we propose a routing contrastive loss
that explicitly enhances the prototypical routing process, promoting
intra-expert coherence and inter-expert diversity. Extensive experiments on
ImageNet benchmark demonstrate that ProMoE surpasses state-of-the-art methods
under both Rectified Flow and DDPM training objectives. Code and models will be
made publicly available.

Abstract: Continuous-space video generation has advanced rapidly, while discrete
approaches lag behind due to error accumulation and long-context inconsistency.
In this work, we revisit discrete generative modeling and present Uniform
discRete diffuSion with metric pAth (URSA), a simple yet powerful framework
that bridges the gap with continuous approaches for the scalable video
generation. At its core, URSA formulates the video generation task as an
iterative global refinement of discrete spatiotemporal tokens. It integrates
two key designs: a Linearized Metric Path and a Resolution-dependent Timestep
Shifting mechanism. These designs enable URSA to scale efficiently to
high-resolution image synthesis and long-duration video generation, while
requiring significantly fewer inference steps. Additionally, we introduce an
asynchronous temporal fine-tuning strategy that unifies versatile tasks within
a single model, including interpolation and image-to-video generation.
Extensive experiments on challenging video and image generation benchmarks
demonstrate that URSA consistently outperforms existing discrete methods and
achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
methods. Code and models are available at https://github.com/baaivision/URSA

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autoregressive video diffusion models are capable of long rollouts that are
stable and consistent with history, but they are unable to guide the current
generation with conditioning from the future. In camera-guided video generation
with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with
the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address
this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire
sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of
the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm
that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video
generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained
model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with
Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show
already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce
Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching
by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed
loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS
achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free,
frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera
paths, including Oscar Reutersv\"ard's Impossible Staircase. Results are best
viewed as videos at https://andrewsonga.github.io/gvs.

### [62] [Evaluating Long-Term Memory for Long-Context Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23730)

TL;DR: 研究评估了记忆增强方法在长上下文对话任务中的效果，发现这类方法可减少90%以上的token使用并保持准确率。记忆架构复杂度应与模型能力相匹配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为提高大型语言模型的对话连续性和经验学习能力，需探索有效的记忆系统类型。

Method: 通过LoCoMo基准测试，分析了语义记忆、情节记忆和过程记忆等多种记忆增强方法。

Result: 记忆增强方法显著减少token使用并保持准确性，不同类型记忆对不同模型效果各异。

Conclusion: 记忆架构设计应与模型能力相适应，情节记忆能帮助LLMs识别知识局限。

Abstract: In order for large language models to achieve true conversational continuity
and benefit from experiential learning, they need memory. While research has
focused on the development of complex memory systems, it remains unclear which
types of memory are most effective for long-context conversational tasks. We
present a systematic evaluation of memory-augmented methods using LoCoMo, a
benchmark of synthetic long-context dialogues annotated for question-answering
tasks that require diverse reasoning strategies. We analyse full-context
prompting, semantic memory through retrieval-augmented generation and agentic
memory, episodic memory through in-context learning, and procedural memory
through prompt optimization. Our findings show that memory-augmented approaches
reduce token usage by over 90% while maintaining competitive accuracy. Memory
architecture complexity should scale with model capability, with small
foundation models benefitting most from RAG, and strong instruction-tuned
reasoning model gaining from episodic learning through reflections and more
complex agentic semantic memory. In particular, episodic memory can help LLMs
recognise the limits of their own knowledge.

TL;DR: BitSkip是一个探索大型语言模型（LLM）效率的混合架构框架，研究发现简单的8位量化模型（BitSkip-V1）表现优于复杂的4位模型，且接近全精度基线。Hadamard变换会显著降低性能，而BitSkip-V1在早期退出特性上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是探索极端量化和动态路由等复杂技术组合的效果，填补对这些方法相互作用理解的空白。

Method: 引入BitSkip架构框架，比较不同量化精度和Hadamard变换的效果，测试模型性能和稳定性。

Result: BitSkip-V1（8位无Hadamard）性能优于4位和Hadamard增强模型，接近全精度基线；Hadamard变换导致性能下降37000%。BitSkip-V1在早期退出时能实现32.5%的速度提升，牺牲4%的质量。

Conclusion: 简单量化模型可能比复杂方法更有效，Hadamard变换需谨慎使用；BitSkip-V1展示了高效平衡速度和质量的潜力。

Abstract: The pursuit of efficient Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to increasingly
complex techniques like extreme quantization and dynamic routing. While
individual benefits of these methods are well-documented, their compositional
effects remain poorly understood. This paper introduces BitSkip, a hybrid
architectural framework for systematically explor- ing these interactions.
Counter-intuitively, our findings reveal that a simple 8-bit quantized model
without Hadamard transform (BitSkip-V1) not only outperforms its more complex
4-bit and Hadamard-enhanced counterparts but also competes the full-precision
baseline in quality (perplexity of 1.13 vs 1.19) . The introduction of Hadamard
transforms, even at 8- bit precision, catastrophically degraded performance by
over 37,000%, tracing fundamental training instability. Our BitSkip-V1 recipe
demonstrates superior early-exit characteristics, with layer 18 providing
optimal 32.5% speed gain for minimal 4% quality loss.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 大语言模型（LLMs）在处理文化相关的语言，尤其是理解和使用具有文化细微差别的比喻表达时存在挑战。评估显示LLMs在阿拉伯语习语和谚语上的表现明显低于英语谚语，且在实用和隐含意义任务中表现较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估LLMs对文化语境中比喻表达的理解和使用能力，揭示其在跨文化语言处理中的局限性。

Method: 设计针对语境理解、实用使用和隐含意义解释的任务，评估22个开源和闭源LLMs在阿拉伯语和英语谚语及习语上的表现。

Result: LLMs在英语谚语上表现最佳，阿拉伯语谚语次之，埃及习语最差；实用任务准确率下降14.07%，但上下文提供可提升10.66%。隐含意义理解最高达85.58%的人类注释一致性。

Conclusion: 比喻语言是文化推理的有效诊断工具；LLMs虽能理解比喻意义，但在适境使用上仍有挑战。数据集Kinayat将支持未来研究。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive evaluation of the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to process culturally grounded language, specifically to understand and
pragmatically use figurative expressions that encode local knowledge and
cultural nuance. Using figurative language as a proxy for cultural nuance and
local knowledge, we design evaluation tasks for contextual understanding,
pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation in Arabic and English. We
evaluate 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on Egyptian Arabic idioms,
multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Our results show a
consistent hierarchy: the average accuracy for Arabic proverbs is 4.29% lower
than for English proverbs, and performance for Egyptian idioms is 10.28% lower
than for Arabic proverbs. For the pragmatic use task, accuracy drops by 14.07%
relative to understanding, though providing contextual idiomatic sentences
improves accuracy by 10.66%. Models also struggle with connotative meaning,
reaching at most 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with 100%
inter-annotator agreement. These findings demonstrate that figurative language
serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning: while LLMs can often
interpret figurative meaning, they face challenges in using it appropriately.
To support future research, we release Kinayat, the first dataset of Egyptian
Arabic idioms designed for both figurative understanding and pragmatic use
evaluation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语模型多基于孤立词汇数据，忽略了自然对话中的变异性，尤其是在教育场景中教师和学生使用新词汇的动态适应行为。

Method: 收集ASL STEM对话的运动捕捉数据，对比分析互动手语、独白手语和口译文章的连续运动学特征，量化时空变化。

Result: 发现对话中的手语时长比孤立手语短24.6%-44.6%，且在独白中未观察到显著减少。评估了手语嵌入模型对STEM词汇的识别能力。

Conclusion: 通过结合语言学分析和计算建模，研究了语用手势如何影响手语表达及其在手语技术中的表征。

Abstract: Most state-of-the-art sign language models are trained on interpreter or
isolated vocabulary data, which overlooks the variability that characterizes
natural dialogue. However, human communication dynamically adapts to contexts
and interlocutors through spatiotemporal changes and articulation style. This
specifically manifests itself in educational settings, where novel vocabularies
are used by teachers, and students. To address this gap, we collect a motion
capture dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering, and Mathematics) dialogue that enables quantitative comparison
between dyadic interactive signing, solo signed lecture, and interpreted
articles. Using continuous kinematic features, we disentangle dialogue-specific
entrainment from individual effort reduction and show spatiotemporal changes
across repeated mentions of STEM terms. On average, dialogue signs are
24.6%-44.6% shorter in duration than the isolated signs, and show significant
reductions absent in monologue contexts. Finally, we evaluate sign embedding
models on their ability to recognize STEM signs and approximate how entrained
the participants become over time. Our study bridges linguistic analysis and
computational modeling to understand how pragmatics shape sign articulation and
its representation in sign language technologies.

Motivation: 语言模型在处理心理健康危机（如自杀倾向、家暴等）时的检测能力尚不成熟，未能可靠标记这些情况可能导致严重后果。

Method: 通过多数投票集成多个语言模型自动标注约4K训练示例，并在共识和一致同意标准下微调六个危机检测模型。

Result: CRADLE BENCH显著优于单模型标注，并提供了不同协议标准下训练的互补模型。

Conclusion: CRADLE BENCH为心理健康危机检测提供了全面的基准和工具，有助于语言模型更准确地识别危机情况。

Abstract: Detecting mental health crisis situations such as suicide ideation, rape,
domestic violence, child abuse, and sexual harassment is a critical yet
underexplored challenge for language models. When such situations arise during
user--model interactions, models must reliably flag them, as failure to do so
can have serious consequences. In this work, we introduce CRADLE BENCH, a
benchmark for multi-faceted crisis detection. Unlike previous efforts that
focus on a limited set of crisis types, our benchmark covers seven types
defined in line with clinical standards and is the first to incorporate
temporal labels. Our benchmark provides 600 clinician-annotated evaluation
examples and 420 development examples, together with a training corpus of
around 4K examples automatically labeled using a majority-vote ensemble of
multiple language models, which significantly outperforms single-model
annotation. We further fine-tune six crisis detection models on subsets defined
by consensus and unanimous ensemble agreement, providing complementary models
trained under different agreement criteria.

Conclusion: Combo-Eval是一种高效且准确的NLR评估方法，适用于多种场景。

Abstract: In modern industry systems like multi-turn chat agents, Text-to-SQL
technology bridges natural language (NL) questions and database (DB) querying.
The conversion of tabular DB results into NL representations (NLRs) enables the
chat-based interaction. Currently, NLR generation is typically handled by large
language models (LLMs), but information loss or errors in presenting tabular
results in NL remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel
evaluation method - Combo-Eval - for judgment of LLM-generated NLRs that
combines the benefits of multiple existing methods, optimizing evaluation
fidelity and achieving a significant reduction in LLM calls by 25-61%.
Accompanying our method is NLR-BIRD, the first dedicated dataset for NLR
benchmarking. Through human evaluations, we demonstrate the superior alignment
of Combo-Eval with human judgments, applicable across scenarios with and
without ground truth references.

Motivation: 非洲语言在多语言文本嵌入任务中代表性不足，本文旨在填补这一空白并提供更全面的评估基准和优化模型。

Method: 通过扩展MMTEB创建AfriMTEB，涵盖59种语言和14项任务；通过跨语言对比蒸馏优化mE5模型得到AfriE5。

Result: AfriE5在评估中表现优于Gemini-Embeddings和mE5等基线模型。

Conclusion: AfriMTEB和AfriE5为非洲语言的文本嵌入任务提供了更全面的评估标准和先进的解决方案。

Abstract: Text embeddings are an essential building component of several NLP tasks such
as retrieval-augmented generation which is crucial for preventing
hallucinations in LLMs. Despite the recent release of massively multilingual
MTEB (MMTEB), African languages remain underrepresented, with existing tasks
often repurposed from translation benchmarks such as FLORES clustering or
SIB-200. In this paper, we introduce AfriMTEB -- a regional expansion of MMTEB
covering 59 languages, 14 tasks, and 38 datasets, including six newly added
datasets. Unlike many MMTEB datasets that include fewer than five languages,
the new additions span 14 to 56 African languages and introduce entirely new
tasks, such as hate speech detection, intent detection, and emotion
classification, which were not previously covered. Complementing this, we
present AfriE5, an adaptation of the instruction-tuned mE5 model to African
languages through cross-lingual contrastive distillation. Our evaluation shows
that AfriE5 achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong
baselines such as Gemini-Embeddings and mE5.

Conclusion: 研究强调需要扩展公平性与安全性研究，涵盖更多多样性社区，以应对大型语言模型中的刻板偏见问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models have been shown to demonstrate stereotypical biases in
their representations and behavior due to the discriminative nature of the data
that they have been trained on. Despite significant progress in the development
of methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in
their decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias
alignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general
augmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is
applicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application
of augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question
Answering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including
state-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to
perturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave
stereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have
biased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community
less studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and
safety research to include more diverse communities.

Result: 实证显示自动提示级联比传统链式思维提示在精确率和召回率上提升8-10%，专家时间减少99%。

Conclusion: 该方法高效、可扩展，适用于多语言和多样化质量评估任务。

Abstract: We introduce a novel, training free cascade for auto-prompting Large Language
Models (LLMs) to assess product quality in e-commerce. Our system requires no
training labels or model fine-tuning, instead automatically generating and
refining prompts for evaluating attribute quality across tens of thousands of
product category-attribute pairs. Starting from a seed of human-crafted
prompts, the cascade progressively optimizes instructions to meet
catalog-specific requirements. This approach bridges the gap between general
language understanding and domain-specific knowledge at scale in complex
industrial catalogs. Our extensive empirical evaluations shows the auto-prompt
cascade improves precision and recall by $8-10\%$ over traditional
chain-of-thought prompting. Notably, it achieves these gains while reducing
domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute - a $99\%$
reduction. Additionally, the cascade generalizes effectively across five
languages and multiple quality assessment tasks, consistently maintaining
performance gains.

Conclusion: 论文提出语义评估指标的必要性，为解决多语言LLM遗忘学习中的语言混淆问题提供了新方向。

Abstract: There have been a couple of studies showing that attempting to erase
multilingual knowledge using only English data is insufficient for multilingual
LLMs. However, their analyses remain highly performance-oriented. In this
paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional
blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned
with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion
occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input
prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing
the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in
three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to
quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in
multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false
negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of
unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated
sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RAG应用在医疗问答中存在信息错误和外部知识使用不当的问题，需要一种方法来验证响应的准确性。

Method: M-Eval方法结合了循证医学的异质性分析，从外部知识库中提取文献并与RAG生成的证据进行对比，验证观点一致性。

Result: 该方法在不同大型语言模型上实现了最高23.31%的准确性提升。

Conclusion: M-Eval能够有效检测RAG系统中的错误，提高LLM应用的可靠性并减少诊断错误。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented Generation (RAG) has demonstrated potential in enhancing
medical question-answering systems through the integration of large language
models (LLMs) with external medical literature. LLMs can retrieve relevant
medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently. However,
current RAG applications still face problems. They generate incorrect
information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge
correctly. To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval. This
method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in
Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG
responses using evidence from multiple sources. First, we extract additional
medical literature from external knowledge bases. Then, we retrieve the
evidence documents generated by the RAG system. We use heterogeneity analysis
to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response. In
addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the
reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system. Our method shows an
improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs. This work can help
detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems. It also makes the

TL;DR: 该论文提出PICOs-RAG方法，通过扩展和规范化用户查询，结合EBM中的PICO格式提升检索效率，将LLM转化为可靠的医疗助手。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RAG方法在复杂临床查询中检索不相关证据和生成无用答案的问题，提升EBM研究的客观性和效率。

Method: 利用PICOs-RAG扩展和规范化用户查询，借助PICO格式提取关键信息，优化检索过程。

Result: 相比基线方法，检索效率和相关性提升高达8.8%。

Conclusion: PICOs-RAG显著提升了LLM在EBM中的实用性和可靠性。

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) research has always been of paramount
importance. It is important to find appropriate medical theoretical support for
the needs from physicians or patients to reduce the occurrence of medical
accidents. This process is often carried out by human querying relevant
literature databases, which lacks objectivity and efficiency. Therefore,
researchers utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to search for evidence
and generate responses automatically. However, current RAG methods struggle to
handle complex queries in real-world clinical scenarios. For example, when
queries lack certain information or use imprecise language, the model may
retrieve irrelevant evidence and generate unhelpful answers. To address this
issue, we present the PICOs-RAG to expand the user queries into a better
format. Our method can expand and normalize the queries into professional ones
and use the PICO format, a search strategy tool present in EBM, to extract the
most important information used for retrieval. This approach significantly
enhances retrieval efficiency and relevance, resulting in up to an 8.8\%
improvement compared to the baseline evaluated by our method. Thereby the
PICOs-RAG improves the performance of the large language models into a helpful
and reliable medical assistant in EBM.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于EBM的新方法，通过重排序和过滤医学证据，提升语言模型（LLMs）在诊断任务中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EBM在临床应用中至关重要，但现有方法（如RAG）难以高效区分高质量证据。受EBM中meta分析的启发，旨在优化证据提取。

Method: 结合多种EBM方法（可靠性分析、异质性分析、外推分析）模拟meta分析，重新排序和过滤医学证据。

Result: 实验显示准确性提升高达11.4%，能从PubMed数据集中提取更高质量和可靠的证据。

Conclusion: 该方法有效减少错误知识的输入，帮助用户获得更可靠的回应。

Abstract: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) holds a crucial role in clinical application.
Given suitable medical articles, doctors effectively reduce the incidence of
misdiagnoses. Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs)
techniques like RAG for EBM tasks. However, the EBM maintains stringent
requirements for evidence, and RAG applications in EBM struggle to efficiently
distinguish high-quality evidence. Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis
used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical
evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence
for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate
the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis,
and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the
best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality
articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and
results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more
reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset. This work can reduce the infusion of
incorrect knowledge into responses and help users receive more effective
replies.

*Hao An,Yang Xu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于细粒度语义置信度奖励的新方法（FiSCoRe），通过强化学习框架提升大语言模型（LLM）在未知问题上的戒断能力，显著提高了模型的可靠性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖粗粒度信号（如整体置信度）来指导LLMs戒断回答，可能导致模型对自身知识边界认识不准确。需要更精确的方法来提升戒断能力。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，通过细粒度语义置信度奖励（FiSCoRe）训练LLMs：采样多个候选答案并进行语义聚类，保留高置信度簇的答案，丢弃低置信度的答案。

Result: 在领域内和领域外基准测试中，该方法显著提高了模型的可靠性。

Conclusion: FiSCoRe通过细粒度语义置信度奖励有效提升了LLMs的戒断能力，增强了模型的可靠性。

Abstract: Mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for
their reliable deployment. Existing methods typically fine-tune LLMs to abstain
from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope. However, these methods
often rely on coarse-grained signals to guide LLMs to abstain, such as overall
confidence or uncertainty scores on multiple sampled answers, which may result
in an imprecise awareness of the model's own knowledge boundaries. To this end,
we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on
$\textbf{\underline{Fi}ne-grained \underline{S}emantic \underline{Co}nfidence
\underline{Re}ward (\Ours)}$, which guides LLMs to abstain via sample-specific
confidence. Specifically, our method operates by sampling multiple candidate
answers and conducting semantic clustering, then training the LLM to retain
answers within high-confidence clusters and discard those within low-confidence
ones, thereby promoting accurate post-hoc abstention. Additionally, we propose
a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention fine-tuning tasks
more comprehensively. Our method significantly enhances reliability in both
in-domain and out-of-distribution benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的知识蒸馏方法SpecKD，通过动态门控机制选择性应用蒸馏损失，提升学生模型的性能和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蒸馏方法对所有token均匀应用蒸馏损失，忽略了教师模型的置信度，可能导致噪声引入。

Method: 提出Speculative Knowledge Distillation（SpecKD），引入动态的token级门控机制，选择性应用蒸馏损失。

Result: 在多文本生成任务中，SpecKD显著优于基线方法，训练更稳定，学生模型性能更高。

Conclusion: SpecKD是一种有效的知识蒸馏框架，能够提升学生模型性能，适用于大规模语言模型的压缩。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone technique for
compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student
models. However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation
loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This
indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn
from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately
harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more
powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation
(SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic,
token-level gating mechanism inspired by the "propose-and-verify" paradigm of
speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified
against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively
applied only to "accepted" tokens, while "rejected" tokens are masked out.
Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD
consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more
stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art
results.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种训练大型多模态模型形成语言惯例的方法，通过模拟参考游戏提高模型与人类沟通的效率和成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过共享对话上下文逐渐提高沟通效率和成功率，形成临时语言惯例。研究旨在让大型多模态模型也能形成此类惯例。

Method: 利用模拟参考游戏（涉及照片和七巧图）训练模型，无需额外人类数据。

Result: 模型与人类沟通时，消息长度减少41%，成功率提高15%，人类响应更快。仅基于成功或成本训练不足以形成惯例。

Conclusion: 同时考虑成功和成本才能有效形成语言惯例，提高模型与人类的沟通效率。

Abstract: Humans leverage shared conversational context to become increasingly
successful and efficient at communicating over time. One manifestation of this
is the formation of ad hoc linguistic conventions, which allow people to
coordinate on short, less costly utterances that are understood using shared
conversational context. We present a method to train large multimodal models to
form conventions, enabling efficient communication. Our approach uses simulated
reference games between models, and requires no additional human-produced data.
In repeated reference games involving photographs and tangram images, our
method enables models to communicate efficiently with people: reducing the
message length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over the course of
the interaction. Human listeners respond faster when interacting with our model
that forms conventions. We also show that training based on success or cost
alone is insufficient - both are necessary to elicit convention formation.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个诊断框架HalloMTBench，用于揭示多语言大语言模型（LLMs）在翻译中的幻觉问题，并评估了17种LLMs的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器翻译基准无法有效暴露多语言LLMs的幻觉问题，因此需要开发一种新的诊断工具。

Method: 引入了一个分类框架，区分指令脱离和源脱离，并创建了多语言、人工验证的HalloMTBench基准，包括11种英语到其他语言的翻译方向。

Result: 评估发现了独特的‘幻觉触发器’，反映了模型规模、源长度敏感性、语言偏见和RL放大语言混合等问题。

Conclusion: HalloMTBench为诊断LLM翻译失败提供了前瞻性测试平台。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced machine translation but remain
vulnerable to hallucinations. Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not
capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in
multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that
separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this
taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark
across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate
candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and
expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances. We have
evaluated 17 LLMs on HalloMTBench. Results reveal distinct ``hallucination
triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length
sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified
language mixing. HalloMTBench offers a forward-looking testbed for diagnosing
LLM translation failures. HalloMTBench is available in

Motivation: 填补文化特异性评测基准的空白，覆盖多样语言和文化。

Method: 构建覆盖116种语言的常识推理数据集，50%以上内容涉及本土文化元素。

Result: LLMs在低资源语言中表现较差（准确率差距达37%），开源模型表现不如专有模型。

Conclusion: Global PIQA展示了LLMs在日常知识上的不足，同时揭示了语言和文化的多样性。

Abstract: To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for
large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and
cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense
reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335
researchers from 65 countries around the world. The 116 language varieties in
Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing
systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples
reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific
elements. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in
aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up
to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally
perform worse than proprietary models. Global PIQA highlights that in many
languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement,
alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and
expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA
provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language
is embedded.

Conclusion: 这项研究有助于保护方言多样性，并推动为孟加拉语社区开发更包容的语言技术工具。

Abstract: The Bengali language, spoken extensively across South Asia and among
diasporic communities, exhibits considerable dialectal diversity shaped by
geography, culture, and history. Phonological and pronunciation-based
classifications broadly identify five principal dialect groups: Eastern
Bengali, Manbhumi, Rangpuri, Varendri, and Rarhi. Within Bangladesh, further
distinctions emerge through variation in vocabulary, syntax, and morphology, as
observed in regions such as Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Noakhali,
and Barishal. Despite this linguistic richness, systematic research on the
computational processing of Bengali dialects remains limited. This study seeks
to document and analyze the phonetic and morphological properties of these
dialects while exploring the feasibility of building computational models
particularly Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems tailored to regional
varieties. Such efforts hold potential for applications in virtual assistants
and broader language technologies, contributing to both the preservation of
dialectal diversity and the advancement of inclusive digital tools for
Bengali-speaking communities. The dataset created for this study is released
for public use.

Conclusion: Squrve为处理复杂实时查询提供了新途径，推动了Text-to-SQL技术的实际应用。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL technology has evolved rapidly, with diverse academic methods
achieving impressive results. However, deploying these techniques in real-world
systems remains challenging due to limited integration tools. Despite these
advances, we introduce Squrve, a unified, modular, and extensive Text-to-SQL
framework designed to bring together research advances and real-world
applications. Squrve first establishes a universal execution paradigm that
standardizes invocation interfaces, then proposes a multi-actor collaboration
mechanism based on seven abstracted effective atomic actor components.
Experiments on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate that the collaborative
workflows consistently outperform the original individual methods, thereby
opening up a new effective avenue for tackling complex real-world queries. The

TL;DR: 论文通过改进传统的行级过滤技术，提出了两种新方法（PLD和PTF），以保留更多有价值的内容，提升了语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行级过滤技术（如去重和尾标点过滤）可能丢弃有价值内容，影响下游表现。

Method: 提出PLD和PTF方法，结合行级信号和文档序列分布，保留结构化重要内容。

Result: 在英语和韩语的小型语言模型（10亿参数）上验证，多项选择和生成问答任务表现显著提升。

Conclusion: 新方法有效改进了传统过滤技术的不足，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: While traditional line-level filtering techniques, such as line-level
deduplication and trailing-punctuation filters, are commonly used, these basic
methods can sometimes discard valuable content, negatively affecting downstream
performance. In this paper, we introduce two methods-pattern-aware line-level
deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF)-by
enhancing the conventional filtering techniques. Our approach not only
considers line-level signals but also takes into account their sequential
distribution across documents, enabling us to retain structurally important
content that might otherwise be removed. We evaluate these proposed methods by
training small language models (1 B parameters) in both English and Korean. The
results demonstrate that our methods consistently improve performance on
multiple-choice benchmarks and significantly enhance generative
question-answering accuracy on both SQuAD v1 and KorQuAD v1.

Abstract: We present Ko-MuSR, the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate
multistep, soft reasoning in long Korean narratives while minimizing data
contamination. Built following MuSR, Ko-MuSR features fully Korean narratives,
reasoning chains, and multiple-choice questions verified by human annotators
for logical consistency and answerability. Evaluations of four large language
models -- two multilingual and two Korean-specialized -- show that multilingual
models outperform Korean-focused ones even in Korean reasoning tasks,
indicating cross-lingual generalization of reasoning ability. Carefully
designed prompting strategies, which combine few-shot examples, reasoning
traces, and task-specific hints, further boost accuracy, approaching
human-level performance. Ko-MuSR offers a solid foundation for advancing Korean
NLP by enabling systematic evaluation of long-context reasoning and prompting
strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 讽刺作为复杂的修辞手法在社交媒体中普遍存在，对自然语言理解和情感分析提出了挑战。随着多模态大语言模型的兴起，讽刺检测需要整合文本以外的音频和视觉线索。

Method: 构建MuSaG数据集，包含手动选择和人工标注的德语电视节目片段，涵盖文本、音频和视频三种模态。对九种开源和商业模型进行了基准测试，并与人类标注进行比较。

Result: 结果表明，人类在对话场景中主要依赖音频线索，而模型在文本上表现最佳，揭示了当前多模态模型的不足。

Conclusion: MuSaG数据集的发布旨在支持未来多模态讽刺检测和人类模型对齐的研究。

Abstract: Sarcasm is a complex form of figurative language in which the intended
meaning contradicts the literal one. Its prevalence in social media and popular
culture poses persistent challenges for natural language understanding,
sentiment analysis, and content moderation. With the emergence of multimodal
large language models, sarcasm detection extends beyond text and requires
integrating cues from audio and vision. We present MuSaG, the first German
multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually
selected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each
instance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated
separately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings.
We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio,
vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human
annotations. Our results show that while humans rely heavily on audio in

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 探讨外部知识集成对自然语言生成（NLG）的影响，特别是在常识生成任务中，通过创建KITGI基准和实验发现相关外部知识对NLG的连贯性和概念覆盖至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究外部知识在NLG任务中的作用，尤其是如何通过知识集成提升生成文本的常识合理性和概念覆盖。

Method: 扩展CommonGen数据集为KITGI基准，使用T5-Large模型比较完整知识和过滤知识条件下的生成效果，并通过三阶段方法评估输出质量。

Result: 完整知识条件下的生成正确率为91%，过滤后降至6%，表明相关知识对NLG性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 设计可解释的知识增强NLG系统及评估框架的重要性，需超越表面指标捕捉底层推理。

Abstract: This paper explores the influence of external knowledge integration in
Natural Language Generation (NLG), focusing on a commonsense generation task.
We extend the CommonGen dataset by creating KITGI, a benchmark that pairs input
concept sets with retrieved semantic relations from ConceptNet and includes
manually annotated outputs. Using the T5-Large model, we compare sentence
generation under two conditions: with full external knowledge and with filtered
knowledge where highly relevant relations were deliberately removed. Our
interpretability benchmark follows a three-stage method: (1) identifying and
removing key knowledge, (2) regenerating sentences, and (3) manually assessing
outputs for commonsense plausibility and concept coverage. Results show that
sentences generated with full knowledge achieved 91\% correctness across both
criteria, while filtering reduced performance drastically to 6\%. These
findings demonstrate that relevant external knowledge is critical for
maintaining both coherence and concept coverage in NLG. This work highlights
the importance of designing interpretable, knowledge-enhanced NLG systems and
calls for evaluation frameworks that capture the underlying reasoning beyond
surface-level metrics.

TL;DR: 论文讨论了如何在不同规模的LLM间实现精细化的参数知识转移（PKT），提出了一种以激活为媒介的层间知识转移方法，解决了现有方法因神经不兼容性导致的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是解决LLM在不同规模间知识转移的效率和效果问题，以增强知识转移的灵活性和适用性。

Method: 方法是通过潜在空间中的语义对齐，以激活为媒介进行层间知识转移，取代直接使用层参数。

Result: 在四个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，优于先前工作，并能更好地对齐不同规模下的模型行为。

Conclusion: 结论是潜在语义对齐是LLM跨规模知识转移的关键因素，为相关研究提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encode vast amounts of knowledge in their
massive parameters, which is accessible to locate, trace, and analyze. Despite
advances in neural interpretability, it is still not clear how to transfer
knowledge in a fine-grained manner, namely parametric knowledge transfer (PKT).
A key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across
LLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility
and broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural
incompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences
between LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer
parameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic
alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale
knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our
approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer.
Leveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and
outperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales.
Evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further
analysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and
provides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个基于知识和确定性两个轴的大语言模型幻觉分类框架，强调需要针对不同类型的幻觉制定特定的缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通常根据幻觉的外部属性进行分类，而忽视了幻觉可能因其内部机制不同而需要不同的缓解策略。因此，作者旨在探索幻觉的内部属性并提出更有效的分类和缓解方法。

Method: 论文提出了一种基于知识和确定性的双重分类框架，并通过模型特定的数据集构建过程和操纵激活的缓解方法来验证知识分类的有效性。此外，还引入了一种新的评估指标来衡量缓解方法的效果。

Result: 研究表明，不同类型的幻觉确实存在，即使在模型具备正确知识的情况下也可能发生幻觉。同时，现有缓解方法在平均情况下表现良好，但在某些关键案例中效果不佳。

Conclusion: 幻觉分析需要综合考虑知识和确定性两个维度，并根据幻觉的潜在因素制定有针对性的缓解策略。

Abstract: Hallucinations in LLMs present a critical barrier to their reliable usage.
Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external
properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This
external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation
strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for
categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since
parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization
method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that
differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis,
we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those
occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To
validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation,
which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model
activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge
categorization by showing a significant difference between the two
hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and
hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do
occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we
identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models
hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We
introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation
methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on
average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings
highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in
hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that
consider the hallucination underlying factors.

Motivation: 在医疗等敏感领域，LLMs的解释不忠实可能削弱临床医生的信任并导致不安全的决策支持。

Method: 评估了三款LLMs（GPT-4.1-mini、LLaMA 70B、LLaMA 8B）在两个数据集（BBQ和MedQA）上的表现，并通过操纵示例数量、类型、提示策略和训练过程分析影响因素。

Result: 示例数量和质量、提示设计对模型忠实性有显著影响；指令调优阶段提升了MedQA上的忠实性指标。

Conclusion: 研究结果为提升LLMs在敏感领域的解释可信度和可解释性提供了策略指导。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce explanations that do not
faithfully reflect the factors driving their predictions. In healthcare
settings, such unfaithfulness is especially problematic: explanations that omit
salient clinical cues or mask spurious shortcuts can undermine clinician trust
and lead to unsafe decision support. We study how inference and training-time
choices shape explanation faithfulness, focusing on factors practitioners can
control at deployment. We evaluate three LLMs (GPT-4.1-mini, LLaMA 70B, LLaMA
8B) on two datasets-BBQ (social bias) and MedQA (medical licensing questions),
and manipulate the number and type of few-shot examples, prompting strategies,
and training procedure. Our results show: (i) both the quantity and quality of
few-shot examples significantly impact model faithfulness; (ii) faithfulness is
sensitive to prompting design; (iii) the instruction-tuning phase improves
measured faithfulness on MedQA. These findings offer insights into strategies
for enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of LLMs in sensitive
domains.

Result: 在开发集上，词错误率为0.25，字符错误率为0.9；在测试集上，词错误率为0.55，字符错误率为0.13。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态方法在变音符号恢复任务中表现良好，结合文本和语音信息有效提升了模型性能。

Abstract: In this work, we tackle the Diacritic Restoration (DR) task for Arabic
dialectal sentences using a multimodal approach that combines both textual and
speech information. We propose a model that represents the text modality using
an encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech
component is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model.
Our solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former
consists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where
the 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames,
resulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these
averaged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to
merging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the
CATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text
and speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the
CATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further
improve model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during
training, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech. Our
experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a word error rate (WER) of
0.25 and a character error rate (CER) of 0.9 on the development set. On the
test set, our model achieved WER and CER scores of 0.55 and 0.13, respectively.

Motivation: 大型语言模型主要用于成人对话数据训练，缺乏生成适合儿童对话的能力，尤其在低资源语言中更显不足。

Method: 通过盲测比较五种模型生成对话的真实性和发展适宜性，由教育专家评估实际儿童访谈数据与模型生成文本。

Result: 评估者在5岁儿童组的年龄预测准确性较高（ICC=0.75），但多数模型语言复杂度超出目标年龄需求。

Conclusion: 在低资源语言中开发适合儿童的LLM系统面临显著数据挑战，需更多年龄适宜的词汇资源。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), predominantly trained on adult conversational
data, face significant challenges when generating authentic, child-like
dialogue for specialized applications. We present a comparative study
evaluating five different LLMs (GPT-4, RUTER-LLAMA-2-13b, GPTSW, NorMistral-7b,
and NorBloom-7b) to generate age-appropriate Norwegian conversations for
children aged 5 and 9 years. Through a blind evaluation by eleven education
professionals using both real child interview data and LLM-generated text
samples, we assessed authenticity and developmental appropriateness. Our
results show that evaluators achieved strong inter-rater reliability (ICC=0.75)
and demonstrated higher accuracy in age prediction for younger children
(5-year-olds) compared to older children (9-year-olds). While GPT-4 and
NorBloom-7b performed relatively well, most models generated language perceived
as more linguistically advanced than the target age groups. These findings
highlight critical data-related challenges in developing LLM systems for
specialized applications involving children, particularly in low-resource
languages where comprehensive age-appropriate lexical resources are scarce.

Conclusion: MERGE揭示了NLI模型泛化能力的不足，提供了分析工具。

Abstract: In recent years, many generalization benchmarks have shown language models'
lack of robustness in natural language inference (NLI). However, manually
creating new benchmarks is costly, while automatically generating high-quality
ones, even by modifying existing benchmarks, is extremely difficult. In this
paper, we propose a methodology for automatically generating high-quality
variants of original NLI problems by replacing open-class words, while
crucially preserving their underlying reasoning. We dub our generalization test
as MERGE (Minimal Expression-Replacements GEneralization), which evaluates the
correctness of models' predictions across reasoning-preserving variants of the
original problem. Our results show that NLI models' perform 4-20% worse on
variants, suggesting low generalizability even on such minimally altered
problems. We also analyse how word class of the replacements, word probability,
and plausibility influence NLI models' performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习中的轨迹多样性不足，尤其是token级随机采样容易导致相似的推理路径，限制了策略学习的效果。

Method: LATR通过三个阶段实现多样性：在高不确定性生成步骤分支、前瞻模拟每个新分支、以及修剪相似的分支。

Result: LATR平均加速策略学习131%，并在GRPO和DAPO算法上将最终pass@1表现提升了4.2%。

Conclusion: LATR有效解决了轨迹多样性问题，显著提升了强化学习的性能和效率。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly with
algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has proven highly
effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models.
However, a critical bottleneck in current pipelines lies in the limited
diversity of sampled trajectories during group rollouts. Homogeneous
trajectories and their associated rewards would diminish the return signals for
policy updates, thereby hindering effective policy learning. This lack of
diversity stems primarily from token-level stochastic sampling, where local
variations are likely to collapse into near-identical reasoning paths. To
address this limitation, we propose Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR), a
novel rollout strategy designed to explicitly promotes trajectory-level
diversity by enforcing branching into different candidate tokens likely to
yield distinct continuations. Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three
stages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing
lookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that
exhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic
Sampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves
final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy
Optimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks. Our code and
data are publicly available at https://github.com/starreeze/latr.

Conclusion: Critique-RL有效解决了批评模型的判别力与帮助性平衡问题，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model
outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks.
However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for
annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL
approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger
supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor
generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the
response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward
signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to
unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive
feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response
is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains.
To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In
stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct
rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on
actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its
discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across
various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance
improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a
5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.

Conclusion: 开发的数据集将公开发布以支持文化和语言包容性评估的进一步研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to answer everyday
questions, yet their performance on culturally grounded and dialectal content
remains uneven across languages. We propose a comprehensive method that (i)
translates Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) multiple-choice questions (MCQs) into
English and several Arabic dialects, (ii) converts them into open-ended
questions (OEQs), (iii) benchmarks a range of zero-shot and fine-tuned LLMs
under both MCQ and OEQ settings, and (iv) generates chain-of-thought (CoT)
rationales to fine-tune models for step-by-step reasoning. Using this method,
we extend an existing dataset in which QAs are parallelly aligned across
multiple language varieties, making it, to our knowledge, the first of its
kind. We conduct extensive experiments with both open and closed models. Our
findings show that (i) models underperform on Arabic dialects, revealing
persistent gaps in culturally grounded and dialect-specific knowledge; (ii)
Arabic-centric models perform well on MCQs but struggle with OEQs; and (iii)
CoT improves judged correctness while yielding mixed n-gram-based metrics. The
developed dataset will be publicly released to support further research on

Conclusion: LongWeave提供了一种平衡真实性和可验证性的评估框架，揭示了当前模型在长篇生成中的局限性。

Abstract: Generating long, informative, and factual outputs remains a major challenge
for Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing benchmarks for long-form generation
typically assess real-world queries with hard-to-verify metrics or use
synthetic setups that ease evaluation but overlook real-world intricacies. In
this paper, we introduce \textbf{LongWeave}, which balances real-world and
verifiable assessment with Constraint-Verifier Evaluation (CoV-Eval). CoV-Eval
constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within real-world
scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual
materials, and constraints based on these targets. This ensures that tasks are
both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of
model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave
supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven
distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models
encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world
complexity and output length increase.

Conclusion: COMPEFFDIST高效且全面，显著提升了情感分析模型的实用性。

Abstract: Recent efforts leverage knowledge distillation techniques to develop
lightweight and practical sentiment analysis models. These methods are grounded
in human-written instructions and large-scale user texts. Despite the promising
results, two key challenges remain: (1) manually written instructions are
limited in diversity and quantity, making them insufficient to ensure
comprehensive coverage of distilled knowledge; (2) large-scale user texts incur
high computational cost, hindering the practicality of these methods. To this
end, we introduce COMPEFFDIST, a comprehensive and efficient distillation
framework for sentiment analysis. Our framework consists of two key modules:
attribute-based automatic instruction construction and difficulty-based data
filtering, which correspondingly tackle the aforementioned challenges. Applying
our method across multiple model series (Llama-3, Qwen-3, and Gemma-3), we
enable 3B student models to match the performance of 20x larger teacher models
on most tasks. In addition, our approach greatly outperforms baseline methods
in data efficiency, attaining the same performance level with only 10% of the
data.

Conclusion: SynthWorlds为语言模型提供了一个可控的评估环境，支持精确比较推理与记忆能力。

Abstract: Evaluating the reasoning ability of language models (LMs) is complicated by
their extensive parametric world knowledge, where benchmark performance often
reflects factual recall rather than genuine reasoning. Existing datasets and
approaches (e.g., temporal filtering, paraphrasing, adversarial substitution)
cannot cleanly separate the two. We present SynthWorlds, a framework that
disentangles task reasoning complexity from factual knowledge. In SynthWorlds,
we construct parallel corpora representing two worlds with identical
interconnected structure: a real-mapped world, where models may exploit
parametric knowledge, and a synthetic-mapped world, where such knowledge is
meaningless. On top of these corpora, we design two mirrored tasks as case
studies: multi-hop question answering and page navigation, which maintain equal
reasoning difficulty across worlds. Experiments in parametric-only (e.g.,
closed-book QA) and knowledge-augmented (e.g., retrieval-augmented) LM settings
reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap, defined as the performance boost
models gain from memorized parametric world knowledge. Knowledge acquisition
and integration mechanisms reduce but do not eliminate this gap, highlighting
opportunities for system improvements. Fully automatic and scalable,
SynthWorlds provides a controlled environment for evaluating LMs in ways that
were previously challenging, enabling precise and testable comparisons of
reasoning and memorization.

several smaller-scale LLMs on LuxIT. Subsequent benchmarking against their base
models on Luxembourgish language proficiency examinations, however, yields
mixed results, with performance varying significantly across different models.
LuxIT represents a critical contribution to Luxembourgish natural language
processing and offers a replicable monolingual methodology, though our findings

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive capabilities
in vision-language tasks such as reasoning segmentation, where models generate
segmentation masks based on textual queries. While prior work has primarily
focused on perturbing image inputs, semantically equivalent textual
paraphrases-crucial in real-world applications where users express the same
intent in varied ways-remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a
novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct
paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading
segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases,
we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human
studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level
optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space
of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves
significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on
both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive
baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models.
We reveal that they remain vulnerable to adversarial paraphrasing-even under
strict semantic and grammatical constraints. All code and data will be released
publicly upon acceptance.

Abstract: Personalized text generation requires models not only to produce coherent
text but also to align with a target user's style, tone, and topical focus.
Existing retrieval-augmented approaches such as LaMP and PGraphRAG enrich
profiles with user and neighbor histories, but they stop at generation and
often yield outputs that drift in tone, topic, or style. We present PerFine, a
unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization
through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM
generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic
LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on
tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then
revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across
iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as
Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp,
Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization
over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5
refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These
results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful
paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and
model-agnostic.

Abstract: Hallucination remains one of the key obstacles to the reliable deployment of
large language models (LLMs), particularly in real-world applications. Among
various mitigation strategies, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and
reasoning enhancement have emerged as two of the most effective and widely
adopted approaches, marking a shift from merely suppressing hallucinations to
balancing creativity and reliability. However, their synergistic potential and
underlying mechanisms for hallucination mitigation have not yet been
systematically examined. This survey adopts an application-oriented perspective
of capability enhancement to analyze how RAG, reasoning enhancement, and their
integration in Agentic Systems mitigate hallucinations. We propose a taxonomy
distinguishing knowledge-based and logic-based hallucinations, systematically
examine how RAG and reasoning address each, and present a unified framework
supported by real-world applications, evaluations, and benchmarks.

Abstract: Scientific talks are a growing medium for disseminating research, and
automatically identifying relevant literature that grounds or enriches a talk
would be highly valuable for researchers and students alike. We introduce
Reference Prediction from Talks (RPT), a new task that maps long, and
unstructured scientific presentations to relevant papers. To support research
on RPT, we present Talk2Ref, the first large-scale dataset of its kind,
containing 6,279 talks and 43,429 cited papers (26 per talk on average), where
relevance is approximated by the papers cited in the talk's corresponding
source publication. We establish strong baselines by evaluating
state-of-the-art text embedding models in zero-shot retrieval scenarios, and
propose a dual-encoder architecture trained on Talk2Ref. We further explore
strategies for handling long transcripts, as well as training for domain
adaptation. Our results show that fine-tuning on Talk2Ref significantly
improves citation prediction performance, demonstrating both the challenges of
the task and the effectiveness of our dataset for learning semantic
representations from spoken scientific content. The dataset and trained models
are released under an open license to foster future research on integrating
spoken scientific communication into citation recommendation systems.

Abstract: As Large language models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into our
lives, their inherent social biases remain a pressing concern. Detecting and
evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit
rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess
the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel
word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs
based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association
networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational
structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative
assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method
enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a
valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of
LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we
apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social
biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between
LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of
using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and
generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple
LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible
language technologies.

Abstract: Accurate confidence calibration in Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical
for safe use in high-stakes domains, where clear verbalized confidence enhances
user trust. Traditional methods that mimic reference confidence expressions
often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment.
We propose natural language critiques as a solution, ideally suited for
confidence calibration, as precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain
and often require multiple generations. This paper studies how natural language
critiques can enhance verbalized confidence, addressing: (1) What to critique:
uncertainty (question-focused) or confidence (answer-specific)? Analysis shows
confidence suits multiple-choice tasks, while uncertainty excels in open-ended
scenarios. (2) How to critique: self-critique or critique calibration training?
We propose Self-Critique, enabling LLMs to critique and optimize their
confidence beyond mere accuracy, and CritiCal, a novel Critique Calibration
training method that leverages natural language critiques to improve confidence
calibration, moving beyond direct numerical optimization. Experiments show that
CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive
baselines, even surpassing its teacher model, GPT-4o, in complex reasoning
tasks. CritiCal also shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution
settings, advancing LLM's reliability.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Many words are ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). However,
when a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced.
Disambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS
associated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging.
The problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language
processing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking,
expression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc.
Lexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural
language processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce
multiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct
solution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence
rate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is
unrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a
lexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate
and implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal
description of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation
grammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer
paths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a
combination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by
considering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling
of a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come
spontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often
due to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is
targeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed
specification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be
necessary.

Abstract: Textual humor is enormously diverse and computational studies need to account

analyze a novel corpus of sentences from the Bulwer-Lytton Fiction Contest to
better understand "bad" humor in English. Standard humor detection models
perform poorly on our corpus, and an analysis of literary devices finds that
these sentences combine features common in existing humor datasets (e.g., puns,
irony) with metaphor, metafiction and simile. LLMs prompted to synthesize
contest-style sentences imitate the form but exaggerate the effect by
over-using certain literary devices, and including far more novel
adjective-noun bigrams than human writers. Data, code and analysis are

Abstract: The history of the Korean language is characterized by a discrepancy between
its spoken and written forms and a pivotal shift from Chinese characters to the
Hangul alphabet. However, this linguistic evolution has remained largely
unexplored in NLP due to a lack of accessible historical corpora. To address
this gap, we introduce the Open Korean Historical Corpus, a large-scale, openly
licensed dataset spanning 1,300 years and 6 languages, as well as
under-represented writing systems like Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and
Hanja-Hangul mixed script. This corpus contains 18 million documents and 5
billion tokens from 19 sources, ranging from the 7th century to 2025. We
leverage this resource to quantitatively analyze major linguistic shifts: (1)
Idu usage peaked in the 1860s before declining sharply; (2) the transition from
Hanja to Hangul was a rapid transformation starting around 1890; and (3) North
Korea's lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51 times
higher out-of-vocabulary rates. This work provides a foundational resource for
quantitative diachronic analysis by capturing the history of the Korean
language. Moreover, it can serve as a pre-training corpus for large language
models, potentially improving their understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary in
modern Hangul as well as archaic writing systems.

Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, despite large multilingual
training, struggle in out-of-domain and low-resource scenarios where labeled
data is scarce. We propose BEARD (BEST-RQ Encoder Adaptation with Re-training
and Distillation), a novel framework designed to adapt Whisper's encoder using
unlabeled data. Unlike traditional self-supervised learning methods, BEARD
uniquely combines a BEST-RQ objective with knowledge distillation from a frozen
teacher encoder, ensuring the encoder's complementarity with the pre-trained
decoder. Our experiments focus on the ATCO2 corpus from the challenging Air
Traffic Control (ATC) communications domain, characterized by non-native
speech, noise, and specialized phraseology. Using about 5,000 hours of
untranscribed speech for BEARD and 2 hours of transcribed speech for
fine-tuning, the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous baseline
and fine-tuned model, achieving a relative improvement of 12% compared to the
fine-tuned model. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use a
self-supervised learning objective for domain adaptation of Whisper.

Abstract: Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants,
and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows.
However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the
underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as
research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework
that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the
astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on
archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world
experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific
research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the
paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data
analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper
authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of
both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical
accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current
frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under
20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain
experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific
research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale,
expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent
performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides
a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific
research.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into
machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical
reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large
Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they
often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation
arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic
translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative
refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we
propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates
semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This
enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its
semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive
refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce
Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different
rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both
accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing
superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive
experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm
achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest
baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce
ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only
validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently
difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) have exhibited substantial
potential for parallel text generation, which may enable more efficient
generation compared to autoregressive models. However, current dLLMs suffer
from fixed generation lengths, which indicates the generation lengths of dLLMs
have to be determined before decoding as a hyper-parameter, leading to issues
in efficiency and flexibility. To solve these problems, in this work, we
propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths,
abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately
predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to
natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability
of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on
standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over
traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to
autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama. Our method achieves higher
accuracy and faster inference, elevating dLLMs beyond mere academic novelty and
supporting their practical use in real-world applications. Codes and models
have been released.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态分层稀疏注意力（DHSA）框架，通过在线动态预测注意力稀疏性，解决了传统稀疏方法在长上下文LLM中的适应性问题，同时显著降低了计算成本和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长上下文LLM的二次注意力成本限制了其在资源受限环境中的扩展性。现有的静态稀疏方法无法适应内容变化的注意力需求，而动态方法又依赖于预定义模板或启发式机制，限制了通用性和准确性。

Method: DHSA提出了一种数据驱动框架，动态地将序列分段为可变长度块，并通过长度归一化聚合块内token嵌入。最后，通过上采样块级相似性得分到token级相似性，计算重要性分数以确定保留哪些token级交互。

Result: 在Gemma2上的实验表明，DHSA在准确性上与密集注意力相当，同时减少了20-60%的预填充延迟和35%的峰值内存使用，相比其他基线方法实现了6-18%的相对准确性提升。

Conclusion: DHSA为长上下文的设备端LLM提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案，显著提升了性能和资源效率。

Abstract: The quadratic cost of attention hinders the scalability of long-context LLMs,
especially in resource-constrained settings. Existing static sparse methods
such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to
reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent
variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has
proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend
on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce
generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their
accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods
for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention
(DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity
online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into
variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the
token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying
chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged
embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the
chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate
importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be
preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and
LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing
prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other
representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves
consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower
cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device
LLMs.

Motivation: 尽管新的LLM（如Llama和Mistral）具备多语言预训练和强大的泛化能力，但在不同语言的零样本任务中仍存在挑战。

Method: 研究比较了三种基于前缀的方法（如软提示调优、前缀调优和Llama Adapter）在不同语系和脚本上的表现。

Result: 实验结果表明，前缀方法在Belebele基准上比LoRA基线高出6%，且参数更少。

Conclusion: 前缀方法是低资源多语言场景中LoRA的有效替代方案。

Abstract: With the release of new large language models (LLMs) like Llama and Mistral,
zero-shot cross-lingual transfer has become increasingly feasible due to their
multilingual pretraining and strong generalization capabilities. However,
adapting these decoder-only LLMs to new tasks across languages remains
challenging. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PeFT) techniques like
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) are widely used, prefix-based techniques such as
soft prompt tuning, prefix tuning, and Llama Adapter are less explored,
especially for zero-shot transfer in decoder-only models. We present a
comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual
transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis
further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as
the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix
methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark.
Similar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well. Despite using
only 1.23M learning parameters with prefix tuning, we achieve consistent
improvements across diverse benchmarks. These findings highlight the potential
of prefix-based techniques as an effective and scalable alternative to LoRA,
particularly in low-resource multilingual settings.

Method: 使用255个IsoFLOP训练的Transformers模型，在标准预训练数据集上研究不同任务的表现差距随规模的变化。

Result: 发现不同任务在缩放过程中表现各异：学术任务趋于均衡，方言表现受人口规模影响，AI风险行为分裂。

Conclusion: 缩放虽提升整体性能，但不能消除所有差异，需进一步研究以应对鲁棒性挑战。

Abstract: Scaling laws describe how language models improve with additional data,
parameters, and compute. While widely used, they are typically measured on
aggregate test sets. Aggregate evaluations yield clean trends but average over
heterogeneous subpopulations, obscuring performance disparities. We introduce
relative scaling laws, which track how performance gaps between test
distributions evolve with scale rather than focusing solely on absolute error.
Using 255 decoder-only Transformers trained under matched-compute (IsoFLOP)
budgets from $10^{18}$--$10^{20}$ FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, we
find diverse trajectories: academic domains on MMLU converge toward parity;
regional English dialects shift depending on population size; and clusters of
AI risk behaviours split, with capability- and influence-related risks
increasing during pretraining while adversarial risks do not. These results
show that although scaling improves overall performance, it is not a universal
equalizer. To support further study, we release all model checkpoints from this
work to enable practitioners to measure relative alongside traditional scaling
laws, in order to better prioritize robustness challenges in light of the
bitter lesson.

Abstract: Reward models (RMs) have become essential for aligning large language models
(LLMs), serving as scalable proxies for human evaluation in both training and
inference. However, existing RMs struggle on knowledge-intensive and long-form
tasks, where evaluating correctness requires grounding beyond the model's
internal knowledge. This limitation hinders them from reliably discriminating
subtle quality differences, especially when external evidence is necessary. To
address this, we introduce OpenRM, a tool-augmented long-form reward model that
systematically judges open-ended responses by invoking external tools to gather
relevant evidence. We train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) on over 27K synthesized pairwise examples generated through a
controllable data synthesis framework. The training objective jointly
supervises intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy, incentivizing
our reward model to learn effective evidence-based judgment strategies.
Extensive experiments on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used
benchmarks demonstrate that OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward
modeling approaches. As a further step, we integrate OpenRM into both
inference-time response selection and training-time data selection. This yields
consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks, highlighting the potential
of tool-augmented reward models for scaling reliable long-form evaluation.

Abstract: We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a
large-scale naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to
word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability), we model how
each feature influences dyslexic time costs. We find that all three features
robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that
dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially
predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially
narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing
the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align
with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working
memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical
complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In
short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and
offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for
dyslexics.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: As retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) becomes increasingly widespread, the
role of information retrieval (IR) is shifting from retrieving information for
human users to retrieving contextual knowledge for artificial intelligence (AI)
systems, where relevance becomes difficult to define or annotate beforehand. To
address this challenge, we propose R3, a Retrieval framework optimized for RAG
through trialand-feedback Reinforced contrastive learning. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning,
R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within
the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the
environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the
retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks
demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original
retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving
comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on
post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical,
requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a framework for training large language models
(LLMs) as diagnostic agents with reinforcement learning, enabling them to
manage multi-turn diagnostic processes, adaptively select examinations, and
commit to final diagnoses. Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static
case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive
exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We
present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health
records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and
recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for
realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via
end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that
optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce
DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated
examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written
rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across
diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10
state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two
prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34%
higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation
hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic
accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In
rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by
7.1% in weighted rubric score. These findings indicate that learning policies
in interactive clinical environments confers dynamic and clinically meaningful
diagnostic management abilities unattainable through passive training alone.

Abstract: Human evaluation of machine translation is in an arms race with translation
model quality: as our models get better, our evaluation methods need to be
improved to ensure that quality gains are not lost in evaluation noise. To this
end, we experiment with a two-stage version of the current state-of-the-art
translation evaluation paradigm (MQM), which we call MQM re-annotation. In this
setup, an MQM annotator reviews and edits a set of pre-existing MQM
annotations, that may have come from themselves, another human annotator, or an
automatic MQM annotation system. We demonstrate that rater behavior in
re-annotation aligns with our goals, and that re-annotation results in
higher-quality annotations, mostly due to finding errors that were missed
during the first pass.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and
information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are
complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users
begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet
most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing
benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce
InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can
recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search.
Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we
construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a
target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only
through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best
model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context,
exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced
interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current
strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities
stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold,
revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate
feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for
both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents. The
code is available at https://github.com/FoundationAgents/InteractComp.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical
decision support systems, particularly in the
  context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common
practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP),
  instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students,
residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied
  professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model
reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This
  study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to
evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct,
  role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style.
We test this framework on three medical QA
  datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to
assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our
  results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the
medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they
  primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of
distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation
  across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core
decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform
  across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the
cognitive complexity found in real-world medical
  practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and
emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine
  cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the
related code in the following repository:https:

Abstract: Self-improving systems require environmental interaction for continuous
adaptation. We introduce SPICE (Self-Play In Corpus Environments), a
reinforcement learning framework where a single model acts in two roles: a
Challenger that mines documents from a large corpus to generate diverse
reasoning tasks, and a Reasoner that solves them. Through adversarial dynamics,
the Challenger creates an automatic curriculum at the frontier of the
Reasoner's capability, while corpus grounding provides the rich,
near-inexhaustible external signal necessary for sustained improvement. Unlike
existing ungrounded self-play methods that offer more limited benefits, SPICE
achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning
(+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families. Our analysis reveals how
document grounding is a key ingredient in SPICE to continuously generate its
own increasingly challenging goals and achieve them, enabling sustained
self-improvement.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic
data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training
methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity
information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical
limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative "near-miss"
samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final
answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We
address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our
empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of
ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final
answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group
Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a
dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect
samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to
effectively learn from these "near-misses". Experiments on diverse
question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO
consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our
analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also
induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls,
demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search
agents.

Abstract: Training large language model agents on tasks at the frontier of their
capabilities is key to unlocking advanced reasoning. We introduce a data
synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal
Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve
alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the
AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality,
multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine
supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted
post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive
the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent
capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on
our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding
benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary
agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis
offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative
approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a
core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While
prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe
that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn
constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is
the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities
for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these
challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS
tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a
tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of
target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated
Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic,
Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and
efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that
are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized
for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both
basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp,
GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over
strong baselines.

Conclusion: Conclusion extraction failed

Abstract: LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their
effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in
context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context
saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly
summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical
details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm
centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive
process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a
dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log
to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which
manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular
condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations
to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent
benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual
pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp
and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or
matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the
DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like
OpenAI's o4-mini.

Abstract: Public research results on large-scale supervised finetuning of AI agents
remain relatively rare, since the collection of agent training data presents
unique challenges. In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of
underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across
heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the
agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves
as an "interlingua" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent
training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to
capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding,
software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to
parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments,
we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP
format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for
multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an
average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers
state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool
use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data
are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to
standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.

Abstract: Virtual Reality (VR) games require players to translate high-level semantic
actions into precise device manipulations using controllers and head-mounted
displays (HMDs). While humans intuitively perform this translation based on
common sense and embodied understanding, whether Large Language Models (LLMs)
can effectively replicate this ability remains underexplored. This paper
introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate
semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios
from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II,
and Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o,
Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against
annotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while
top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition
capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial
understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across
games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples
substantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted
enhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities. We release all materials at

Abstract: In this paper, we present our submissions to the unified WMT25 Translation
Evaluation Shared Task. For the Quality Score Prediction subtask, we create a
new generation of MetricX with improvements in the input format and the
training protocol, while for the Error Span Detection subtask we develop a new
model, GemSpanEval, trained to predict error spans along with their severities
and categories. Both systems are based on the state-of-the-art multilingual
open-weights model Gemma 3, fine-tuned on publicly available WMT data. We
demonstrate that MetricX-25, adapting Gemma 3 to an encoder-only architecture
with a regression head on top, can be trained to effectively predict both MQM
and ESA quality scores, and significantly outperforms its predecessor. Our
decoder-only GemSpanEval model, on the other hand, we show to be competitive in
error span detection with xCOMET, a strong encoder-only sequence-tagging
baseline. With error span detection formulated as a generative task, we
instruct the model to also output the context for each predicted error span,
thus ensuring that error spans are identified unambiguously.
