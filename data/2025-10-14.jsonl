We introduce a\nbenchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a\npipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of\ninformation, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on\nparticular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created\ndataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest\ntextual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or\nmore documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a\nnearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline\nhallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with\nopen-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)\na third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and\nhallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly\noutperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,\nwith wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and\ncross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average\nagreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5\nLikert scale (5 indicating \"strongly agree\")."}
