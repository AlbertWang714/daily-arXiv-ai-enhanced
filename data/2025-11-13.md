### [1] [Where did you get that? Towards Summarization Attribution for Analysts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08589)
*Violet B,John M. Conroy,Sean Lynch,Danielle M,Neil P. Molino,Aaron Wiechmann,Julia S. Yang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了自动归因方法，将摘要中的每句话链接到源文本的一个或多个文档部分，并使用混合摘要和自定义拓扑来简化归因并识别错误类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分析师需要明确的归因，因为不知道信息来源就无法进行报告。因此，论文致力于开发自动方法以实现准确的句子级归因。

Method: 采用混合摘要（自动释义的提取式摘要）和自定义拓扑结构，以简化归因过程并识别归因相关错误的不同类别。

Result: 通过实验验证了混合摘要和自定义拓扑在实现句子级归因和错误分类中的有效性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，混合摘要和自定义拓扑能够有效提升归因的准确性，并为后续研究提供了技术基础。

Abstract: Analysts require attribution, as nothing can be reported without knowing the source of the information. In this paper, we will focus on automatic methods for attribution, linking each sentence in the summary to a portion of the source text, which may be in one or more documents. We explore using a hybrid summarization, i.e., an automatic paraphrase of an extractive summary, to ease attribution. We also use a custom topology to identify the proportion of different categories of attribution-related errors.

### [2] [GMTRouter: Personalized LLM Router over Multi-turn User Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08590)
*Encheng Xie,Yihang Sun,Tao Feng,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: GMTRouter利用异构图表示用户与LLM的多轮交互，通过消息传递机制从少量数据中学习用户偏好，实现个性化路由，效果显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户偏好数据稀缺、噪声多且格式不一致，现有方法无法充分个性化捕获用户与LLM的复杂交互。

Method: 将多轮用户-LLM交互表示为异构图（用户、LLM、查询、响应节点），设计轻量级归纳图学习框架捕获用户偏好。

Result: GMTRouter在多个数据集上准确率和AUC分别提高0.9-21.6%和0.006-0.309，且能通过少量数据适应新用户和变化偏好。

Conclusion: GMTRouter提供了一种高效、轻量的个性化LLM路由方案，适用于数据稀疏场景。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) routing has demonstrated strong capability in balancing response quality with computational cost. As users exhibit diverse preferences, personalization has attracted increasing attention in LLM routing, since even identical queries may require different models to generate responses tailored to individual needs. However, existing approaches are not fully personalized and often fail to capture the complex interactions between specific users and LLMs. Moreover, user preference data is typically scarce, noisy, and inconsistent in format, which limits the effectiveness of methods that rely solely on user-specific data. To address these challenges, we propose GMTRouter, which represents multi-turn user-LLM interactions as a heterogeneous graph with four node types: user, LLM, query, and response, thereby preserving the rich relational structure of the interaction. Through a tailored message-passing mechanism, GMTRouter learns to capture user preferences from few-shot data within a lightweight inductive graph learning framework, enabling effective personalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GMTRouter consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving 0.9 to 21.6 percent higher accuracy and 0.006 to 0.309 higher AUC across multiple datasets. More importantly, we demonstrate that GMTRouter can adapt to new users and evolving preferences using only few-shot data, without extensive fine-tuning. The code for GMTRouter is publicly available at https://github.com/ulab-uiuc/GMTRouter.

*Azza Bouleimen,Giordano De Marzo,Taehee Kim,Nicol`o Pagan,Hannah Metzler,Silvia Giordano,David Garcia*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究评估了大型语言模型（LLM）能否模拟社交媒体上的人类群组对话，发现LLM生成的内容在39%的情况下被误认为人类创作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在模拟在线社区和社交媒体对话方面的有效性，验证其是否能用于内容推荐算法测试和政策干预效果评估。

Method: 收集Reddit上真实人类对话，并用Llama 3 70B和GPT-4o生成同一主题的人工对话，通过参与者对比判断其真实性。

Result: LLM生成的对话在39%的情况下被误认为人类创作，尤其是Llama 3生成的内容，参与者仅56%的正确识别率。

Conclusion: LLM能生成足够真实的社交媒体对话，展示了其在社交模拟中的潜力，但也警示了可能被滥用于生成虚假内容的危险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new avenues to simulate online communities and social media. Potential applications range from testing the design of content recommendation algorithms to estimating the effects of content policies and interventions. However, the validity of using LLMs to simulate conversations between various users remains largely untested. We evaluated whether LLMs can convincingly mimic human group conversations on social media. We collected authentic human conversations from Reddit and generated artificial conversations on the same topic with two LLMs: Llama 3 70B and GPT-4o. When presented side-by-side to study participants, LLM-generated conversations were mistaken for human-created content 39\% of the time. In particular, when evaluating conversations generated by Llama 3, participants correctly identified them as AI-generated only 56\% of the time, barely better than random chance. Our study demonstrates that LLMs can generate social media conversations sufficiently realistic to deceive humans when reading them, highlighting both a promising potential for social simulation and a warning message about the potential misuse of LLMs to generate new inauthentic social media content.

### [4] [Knowledge Graph Analysis of Legal Understanding and Violations in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08593)
*Abha Jha,Abel Salinas,Fred Morstatter*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在法律分析中的潜力与风险，尤其是针对生物武器相关法律的解释与合规性问题，并提出了一种结合知识图谱和检索增强生成（RAG）的方法来评估和改进LLMs的安全性和法律推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs在复杂法律框架（如美国法典Title 18 Section 175）的解释和分析中具有潜力，但也存在生成不安全内容的漏洞。研究旨在解决这种矛盾，确保LLMs在法律领域的安全和伦理应用。

Method: 研究提出了一种方法，将知识图谱构建与检索增强生成（RAG）结合，系统性评估LLMs对法律的理解、法律意图判断能力及其潜在不安全应用的倾向。通过结构化实验，测试其识别法律违规、生成禁止性指令及检测非法意图的能力。

Result: 研究发现LLMs在法律推理和安全机制上存在显著局限性，但通过结合增强的安全协议和更完善的法律推理框架，可以为开发安全、伦理的LLMs提供基础。

Conclusion: 研究为未来在敏感法律领域开发既能有效辅助又不会无意中违反法律的LLMs奠定了基础，确保其成为法律的守护者。

Abstract: The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential for interpreting complex legal frameworks, such as Title 18 Section 175 of the US Code, which governs biological weapons. These systems hold promise for advancing legal analysis and compliance monitoring in sensitive domains. However, this capability comes with a troubling contradiction: while LLMs can analyze and interpret laws, they also demonstrate alarming vulnerabilities in generating unsafe outputs, such as actionable steps for bioweapon creation, despite their safeguards. To address this challenge, we propose a methodology that integrates knowledge graph construction with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to systematically evaluate LLMs' understanding of this law, their capacity to assess legal intent (mens rea), and their potential for unsafe applications. Through structured experiments, we assess their accuracy in identifying legal violations, generating prohibited instructions, and detecting unlawful intent in bioweapons-related scenarios. Our findings reveal significant limitations in LLMs' reasoning and safety mechanisms, but they also point the way forward. By combining enhanced safety protocols with more robust legal reasoning frameworks, this research lays the groundwork for developing LLMs that can ethically and securely assist in sensitive legal domains - ensuring they act as protectors of the law rather than inadvertent enablers of its violation.

### [5] [Diverse Preference Learning for Capabilities and Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08594)
*Stewart Slocum,Asher Parker-Sartori,Dylan Hadfield-Menell*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 本文探讨了LLMs在输出多样性上的问题，提出了一种名为Soft Preference Learning的方法，以改善输出多样性，并在能力和对齐性上取得了更好的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs对社会的影响日益增大，其输出多样性变得至关重要。然而现有研究表明，RLHF和DPO等对齐算法会显著降低LLM输出的多样性，导致文本重复且观点狭隘。这被归因于KL散度正则器的使用，使得模型过度重视多数意见而牺牲了多样性。

Method: 本文提出了一种名为Soft Preference Learning的方法，通过解耦KL惩罚中的熵和交叉熵项，实现对LLM输出多样性的细粒度控制。

Result: 实验表明，使用Soft Preference Learning训练的LLM在重复采样任务上准确性更高，输出具有更大的语义和词汇多样性；同时能够代表更广泛的社会观点，并表现出更好的校准性能。

Conclusion: Soft Preference Learning不仅优于标准温度缩放方法，还能在保持模型能力的同时显著提升输出多样性，为LLM的对齐和多样性控制提供了新思路。

Abstract: The ability of LLMs to represent diverse perspectives is critical as they increasingly impact society. However, recent studies reveal that alignment algorithms such as RLHF and DPO significantly reduce the diversity of LLM outputs. Not only do aligned LLMs generate text with repetitive structure and word choice, they also approach problems in more uniform ways, and their responses reflect a narrower range of societal perspectives. We attribute this problem to the KL divergence regularizer employed in preference learning algorithms. This causes the model to systematically overweight majority opinions and sacrifice diversity in its outputs. To address this, we propose Soft Preference Learning, which decouples the entropy and cross-entropy terms in the KL penalty - allowing for fine-grained control over LLM generation diversity. From a capabilities perspective, LLMs trained using Soft Preference Learning attain higher accuracy on difficult repeated sampling tasks and produce outputs with greater semantic and lexical diversity. From an alignment perspective, they are capable of representing a wider range of societal viewpoints and display improved logit calibration. Notably, Soft Preference Learning resembles, but is a Pareto improvement over, standard temperature scaling.

### [6] [What About the Scene with the Hitler Reference? HAUNT: A Framework to Probe LLMs' Self-consistency Via Adversarial Nudge](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08596)
*Arka Dutta,Sujan Dutta,Rijul Magu,Soumyajit Datta,Munmun De Choudhury,Ashiqur R. KhudaBukhsh*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种框架，用于测试大型语言模型（LLMs）在面对对抗性干扰时的事实保真度，发现不同模型在抗干扰能力上存在显著差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幻觉问题是LLMs在高风险领域部署的重大挑战，研究旨在测试不同模型在对抗性干扰下的表现。

Method: 框架分为三步：生成真假陈述，验证这些陈述，最后测试模型对自身生成谎言的鲁棒性。

Result: 测试显示，不同模型的抗干扰能力差异明显：Claude最强，GPT和Grokk中等，Gemini和DeepSeek较弱。

Conclusion: 研究结果对公众依赖LLMs获取信息的可靠性提出了警示。

Abstract: Hallucinations pose a critical challenge to the real-world deployment of large language models (LLMs) in high-stakes domains. In this paper, we present a framework for stress testing factual fidelity in LLMs in the presence of adversarial nudge. Our framework consists of three steps. In the first step, we instruct the LLM to produce sets of truths and lies consistent with the closed domain in question. In the next step, we instruct the LLM to verify the same set of assertions as truths and lies consistent with the same closed domain. In the final step, we test the robustness of the LLM against the lies generated (and verified) by itself. Our extensive evaluation, conducted using five widely known proprietary LLMs across two closed domains of popular movies and novels, reveals a wide range of susceptibility to adversarial nudges: \texttt{Claude} exhibits strong resilience, \texttt{GPT} and \texttt{Grok} demonstrate moderate resilience, while \texttt{Gemini} and \texttt{DeepSeek} show weak resilience. Considering that a large population is increasingly using LLMs for information seeking, our findings raise alarm.

### [7] [Self-HarmLLM: Can Large Language Model Harm Itself?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08597)
*Heehwan Kim,Sungjune Park,Daeseon Choi*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Self-HarmLLM的新攻击场景，利用LLM自身生成的模糊有害查询（MHQ）作为输入，验证了其在不同模型和条件下绕过防御的成功率。研究发现自动评估高估了攻击效果，需重新考虑防御设计和评估方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有防御主要假设攻击来自外部，未充分研究模型自身输出作为攻击向量的可能性。

Method: 提出Self-HarmLLM场景，使用模型生成的MHQ作为新输入，在多种模型和条件下（Base、Zero-shot、Few-shot）进行实验，并通过自动和人工评估验证效果。

Result: Zero-shot条件下转换成功率最高52%，绕过防御成功率33%；Few-shot条件下分别为65%和41%。自动评估高估了成功率（平均高52%）。

Conclusion: 模型自身输出可能成为攻击向量，需重新设计防御机制和更可靠的评估方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are generally equipped with guardrails to block the generation of harmful responses. However, existing defenses always assume that an external attacker crafts the harmful query, and the possibility of a model's own output becoming a new attack vector has not been sufficiently explored. In this study, we propose the Self-HarmLLM scenario, which uses a Mitigated Harmful Query (MHQ) generated by the same model as a new input. An MHQ is an ambiguous query whose original intent is preserved while its harmful nature is not directly exposed. We verified whether a jailbreak occurs when this MHQ is re-entered into a separate session of the same model. We conducted experiments on GPT-3.5-turbo, LLaMA3-8B-instruct, and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B under Base, Zero-shot, and Few-shot conditions. The results showed up to 52% transformation success rate and up to 33% jailbreak success rate in the Zero-shot condition, and up to 65% transformation success rate and up to 41% jailbreak success rate in the Few-shot condition. By performing both prefix-based automated evaluation and human evaluation, we found that the automated evaluation consistently overestimated jailbreak success, with an average difference of 52%. This indicates that automated evaluation alone is not accurate for determining harmfulness. While this study is a toy-level study based on a limited query set and evaluators, it proves that our method can still be a valid attack scenario. These results suggest the need for a fundamental reconsideration of guardrail design and the establishment of a more robust evaluation methodology.

### [8] [Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Pediatric Speech-Language Pathology vignettes: A Proof-of-Concept Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08600)
*Yilan Liu*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 研究提出了一个结合检索增强生成（RAG）与专业知识库的系统，用于自动生成儿科言语病理学（SLP）案例材料，展示了技术可行性，并验证了商业和开源模型的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床案例是言语病理学教育的重要工具，但手动创建耗时。通用大语言模型缺乏领域知识，需专家修订。

Method: 开发了一个多模型RAG系统，结合专业知识和提示模板，测试了商业和开源模型在七种场景下的表现，并通过多维评估标准自动检查生成案例的质量。

Result: 商业模型略优，但开源模型表现可接受；RAG系统能生成符合专业指南的内容，但需进一步专家验证和学生测试。

Conclusion: 该系统技术可行，未来可扩展至临床决策支持、自动IEP目标生成等领域。

Abstract: Clinical vignettes are essential educational tools in speech-language pathology (SLP), but manual creation is time-intensive. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) can generate text, they lack domain-specific knowledge, leading to hallucinations and requiring extensive expert revision. This study presents a proof-of-concept system integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with curated knowledge bases to generate pediatric SLP case materials. A multi-model RAG-based system was prototyped integrating curated domain knowledge with engineered prompt templates, supporting five commercial (GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro) and open-source (Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5-7B) LLMs. Seven test scenarios spanning diverse disorder types and grade levels were systematically designed. Generated cases underwent automated quality assessment using a multi-dimensional rubric evaluating structural completeness, internal consistency, clinical appropriateness, and IEP goal/session note quality. This proof-of-concept demonstrates technical feasibility for RAG-augmented generation of pediatric SLP vignettes. Commercial models showed marginal quality advantages, but open-source alternatives achieved acceptable performance, suggesting potential for privacy-preserving institutional deployment. Integration of curated knowledge bases enabled content generation aligned with professional guidelines. Extensive validation through expert review, student pilot testing, and psychometric evaluation is required before educational or research implementation. Future applications may extend to clinical decision support, automated IEP goal generation, and clinical reflection training.

### [9] [Evaluating DisCoCirc in Translation Tasks & its Limitations: A Comparative Study Between Bengali & English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08601)
*Nazmoon Falgunee Moon*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个基于DisCoCirc框架的孟加拉语语法模型，并将其应用于英语与孟加拉语的翻译任务，结果发现该框架在语言结构差异下存在局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机是将DisCoCirc框架扩展到孟加拉语，并评估其在减少语言官僚主义方面的有效性，同时探索其在翻译任务中的适用性。

Method: 方法是通过扩展DisCoCirc框架，构建适用于孟加拉语的语法模型，并在英语与孟加拉语的翻译任务中进行测试。

Result: 结果表明，尽管DisCoCirc框架在大部分语言中表现良好，但由于两种语言的结构差异，其在翻译任务中仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 结论指出DisCoCirc框架在翻译任务中面临挑战，同时提出了未来改进的可能方向，并对英语连词与布尔逻辑的关系进行了探讨。

Abstract: In [4], the authors present the DisCoCirc (Distributed Compositional Circuits) formalism for the English language, a grammar-based framework derived from the production rules that incorporates circuit-like representations in order to give a precise categorical theoretical structure to the language. In this paper, we extend this approach to develop a similar framework for Bengali and apply it to translation tasks between English and Bengali. A central focus of our work lies in reassessing the effectiveness of DisCoCirc in reducing language bureaucracy. Unlike the result suggested in [5], our findings indicate that although it works well for a large part of the language, it still faces limitations due to the structural variation of the two languages. We discuss the possible methods that might handle these shortcomings and show that, in practice, DisCoCirc still struggles even with relatively simple sentences. This divergence from prior claims not only highlights the framework's constraints in translation but also suggest scope for future improvement. Apart from our primary focus on English-Bengali translation, we also take a short detour to examine English conjunctions, following [1], showing a connection between conjunctions and Boolean logic.

### [10] [Mina: A Multilingual LLM-Powered Legal Assistant Agent for Bangladesh for Empowering Access to Justice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08605)
*Azmine Toushik Wasi,Wahid Faisal,Mst Rafia Islam*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 论文开发了一个名为Mina的多语言法律助手，专门针对孟加拉国的低收​​入群体，解决了现有AI法律助手缺乏孟加拉语支持和本地化适应的​​问题。​​


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国的低收入人群面临法律语言复杂、程序不透明和高成本等障碍，现有AI法律助手无法满足其需求，因此需要开发一个针对本地化的多语言法律助手。

Method: 采用多语言嵌入和基于RAG的工具链框架，实现法律检索、推理、翻译和文档生成功能，并通过交互式聊天界面提供法律草稿、引用和简单解释。

Result: Mina在2022和2023年孟加拉国律师考试中表现优异，在多项测试中得分75-80%，匹配或超过人类平均表现。

Conclusion: Mina展示了作为低成本、多语言AI助手的潜力，可自动化关键法律任务并扩展司法可及性，为低资源系统开发和多语言适应提供了实践案例。

Abstract: Bangladesh's low-income population faces major barriers to affordable legal advice due to complex legal language, procedural opacity, and high costs. Existing AI legal assistants lack Bengali-language support and jurisdiction-specific adaptation, limiting their effectiveness. To address this, we developed Mina, a multilingual LLM-based legal assistant tailored for the Bangladeshi context. It employs multilingual embeddings and a RAG-based chain-of-tools framework for retrieval, reasoning, translation, and document generation, delivering context-aware legal drafts, citations, and plain-language explanations via an interactive chat interface. Evaluated by law faculty from leading Bangladeshi universities across all stages of the 2022 and 2023 Bangladesh Bar Council Exams, Mina scored 75-80% in Preliminary MCQs, Written, and simulated Viva Voce exams, matching or surpassing average human performance and demonstrating clarity, contextual understanding, and sound legal reasoning. These results confirm its potential as a low-cost, multilingual AI assistant that automates key legal tasks and scales access to justice, offering a real-world case study on building domain-specific, low-resource systems and addressing challenges of multilingual adaptation, efficiency, and sustainable public-service AI deployment.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了五种知名大语言模型（LLMs）在急诊医学诊断中的表现，并开发了一个名为MEDAS的超学习器，通过元学习整合这些模型的优势，显著提升了诊断准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在解决急诊医学中快速准确诊断的需求，通过利用AI和大语言模型（LLMs）提升诊断支持系统的性能。

Method: 研究比较了五种LLMs（Gemini、Llama、Grok、GPT和Claude）的诊断能力，并构建了一个超学习器MEDAS，通过元学习整合这些模型的预测结果。

Result: 结果表明，单一LLMs的诊断准确率为58%-65%，而超学习器MEDAS的准确率提升至70%，其中某单一模型在超学习器中表现出85%的准确率。

Conclusion: 元学习整合的LLMs群组能够显著提升诊断准确率，超学习器能够利用各模型的综合知识，优于任何单一模型的表现。

Abstract: Medical decision-support and advising systems are critical for emergency physicians to quickly and accurately assess patients' conditions and make diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force in healthcare in recent years and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been employed in various fields of medical decision-support systems. We studied responses of a group of different LLMs to real cases in emergency medicine. The results of our study on five most renown LLMs showed significant differences in capabilities of Large Language Models for diagnostics acute diseases in medical emergencies with accuracy ranging between 58% and 65%. This accuracy significantly exceeds the reported accuracy of human doctors. We built a super-learner MEDAS (Medical Emergency Diagnostic Advising System) of five major LLMs - Gemini, Llama, Grok, GPT, and Claude). The super-learner produces higher diagnostic accuracy, 70%, even with a quite basic meta-learner. However, at least one of the integrated LLMs in the same super-learner produces 85% correct diagnoses. The super-learner integrates a cluster of LLMs using a meta-learner capable of learning different capabilities of each LLM to leverage diagnostic accuracy of the model by collective capabilities of all LLMs in the cluster. The results of our study showed that aggregated diagnostic accuracy provided by a meta-learning approach exceeds that of any individual LLM, suggesting that the super-learner can take advantage of the combined knowledge of the medical datasets used to train the group of LLMs.

### [12] [Learn More, Forget Less: A Gradient-Aware Data Selection Approach for LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08620)
*Yibai Liu,Shihang Wang,Zeming Liu,Zheming Song,Junzhe Wang,Jingjing Liu,Qingjie Liu,Yunhong Wang*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为GrADS的自适应梯度感知数据选择方法，用于优化大语言模型的监督微调过程，通过分析梯度动态选择高效训练样本，显著提升性能并缓解灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在多任务中表现优异，监督微调（SFT）仍是领域适应的关键步骤，但其资源密集型特性和灾难性遗忘问题亟需解决。

Method: GrADS通过初步训练阶段的梯度分析，设计基于梯度的选择标准，优先选择对模型学习贡献最大的样本，从而获得代表性数据子集。

Result: 实验表明，GrADS在不同领域（如医学、法律和金融）中显著提升了效率和成本效益，使用5%的数据即可超越全数据集微调性能，50%数据时性能大幅提升，灾难性遗忘明显减少。

Conclusion: GrADS为大规模语言模型的高效领域适应提供了创新解决方案，兼顾性能提升与资源节省。

Abstract: Despite large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive achievements across numerous tasks, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) remains essential for adapting these models to specialized domains. However, SFT for domain specialization can be resource-intensive and sometimes leads to a deterioration in performance over general capabilities due to catastrophic forgetting (CF). To address these issues, we propose a self-adaptive gradient-aware data selection approach (GrADS) for supervised fine-tuning of LLMs, which identifies effective subsets of training data by analyzing gradients obtained from a preliminary training phase. Specifically, we design self-guided criteria that leverage the magnitude and statistical distribution of gradients to prioritize examples that contribute the most to the model's learning process. This approach enables the acquisition of representative samples that enhance LLMs understanding of domain-specific tasks. Through extensive experimentation with various LLMs across diverse domains such as medicine, law, and finance, GrADS has demonstrated significant efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Remarkably, utilizing merely 5% of the selected GrADS data, LLMs already surpass the performance of those fine-tuned on the entire dataset, and increasing to 50% of the data results in significant improvements! With catastrophic forgetting substantially mitigated simultaneously. We will release our code for GrADS later.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自杀是全球青少年第二大死因，且社交媒体中存在自杀意图的信号。为解决这一问题，需要一种能准确识别自杀倾向的方法。

Method: 采用CNN架构和BiGRU技术结合的混合深度学习方案，结合注意力机制和SHAP解释性方法。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，该方法准确率达93.97%，优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 提出的框架结合了特征提取、序列建模和可解释性，为自杀检测提供了全面解决方案，效果显著。

Abstract: Worldwide, suicide is the second leading cause of death for adolescents with past suicide attempts to be an important predictor for increased future suicides. While some people with suicidal thoughts may try to suppress them, many signal their intentions in social media platforms. To address these issues, we propose a new type of hybrid deep learning scheme, i.e., the combination of a CNN architecture and a BiGRU technique, which can accurately identify the patterns of suicidal ideation from SN datasets. Also, we apply Explainable AI methods using SHapley Additive exPlanations to interpret the prediction results and verifying the model reliability. This integration of CNN local feature extraction, BiGRU bidirectional sequence modeling, attention mechanisms, and SHAP interpretability provides a comprehensive framework for suicide detection. Training and evaluation of the system were performed on a publicly available dataset. Several performance metrics were used for evaluating model performance. Our method was found to have achieved 93.97 accuracy in experimental results. Comparative study to different state-of-the-art Machine Learning and DL models and existing literature demonstrates the superiority of our proposed technique over all the competing methods.

*Varada Khanna,Nilay Bhatt,Ikgyu Shin,Sule Tinaz,Yang Ren,Hua Xu,Vipina K. Keloth*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究开发了NLP模型，用于从帕金森病患者的第一人称叙述中自动识别反映认知过程的类别，比较了三种模型性能，发现Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct表现最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解帕金森病患者日常生活中的认知体验可以帮助研究疾病相关的认知和情感变化，但从非结构化叙述中提取此类信息具有挑战性。

Method: 研究比较了三种NLP模型：Bio_ClinicalBERT、Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct和GPT-4o mini，用于识别七种认知类别。

Result: Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct表现最佳（F1-得分0.74微平均和0.59宏平均），尤其是在依赖上下文的类别中。Bio_ClinicalBERT在某些类别中表现良好但其他类别失败。

Conclusion: 尽管任务具有挑战性，但NLP系统有望用于帕金森病认知功能的长期监测，并作为神经心理学评估的有价值补充。

Abstract: Understanding how individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD) describe cognitive experiences in their daily lives can offer valuable insights into disease-related cognitive and emotional changes. However, extracting such information from unstructured patient narratives is challenging due to the subtle, overlapping nature of cognitive constructs. This study developed and evaluated natural language processing (NLP) models to automatically identify categories that reflect various cognitive processes from de-identified first-person narratives. Three model families, a Bio_ClinicalBERT-based span categorization model for nested entity recognition, a fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model using QLoRA for instruction following, and GPT-4o mini evaluated under zero- and few-shot settings, were compared on their performance on extracting seven categories. Our findings indicated that model performance varied substantially across categories and model families. The fine-tuned Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct achieved the highest overall F1-scores (0.74 micro-average and 0.59 macro-average), particularly excelling in context-dependent categories such as thought and social interaction. Bio_ClinicalBERT exhibited high precision but low recall and performed comparable to Llama for some category types such as location and time but failed on other categories such as thought, emotion and social interaction. Compared to conventional information extraction tasks, this task presents a greater challenge due to the abstract and overlapping nature of narrative accounts of complex cognitive processes. Nonetheless, with continued refinement, these NLP systems hold promise for enabling low-burden, longitudinal monitoring of cognitive function and serving as a valuable complement to formal neuropsychological assessments in PD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有孟加拉语NLI数据集存在标注错误、语义模糊和语言多样性不足等问题，阻碍了模型的有效训练与评估。

Method: 通过严格的标注流程构建了BNLI数据集，并测试了多种先进模型（包括多语言和孟加拉语专用模型）以评估其效果。

Result: 实验结果表明，BNLI在可靠性和可解释性上有显著提升，为孟加拉语等低资源语言的NLI研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: BNLI为孟加拉语NLI任务提供了一个高质量的数据集，推动了低资源语言推断任务的研究进展。

Abstract: Despite the growing progress in Natural Language Inference (NLI) research, resources for the Bengali language remain extremely limited. Existing Bengali NLI datasets exhibit several inconsistencies, including annotation errors, ambiguous sentence pairs, and inadequate linguistic diversity, which hinder effective model training and evaluation. To address these limitations, we introduce BNLI, a refined and linguistically curated Bengali NLI dataset designed to support robust language understanding and inference modeling. The dataset was constructed through a rigorous annotation pipeline emphasizing semantic clarity and balance across entailment, contradiction, and neutrality classes. We benchmarked BNLI using a suite of state-of-the-art transformer-based architectures, including multilingual and Bengali-specific models, to assess their ability to capture complex semantic relations in Bengali text. The experimental findings highlight the improved reliability and interpretability achieved with BNLI, establishing it as a strong foundation for advancing research in Bengali and other low-resource language inference tasks.

*Junichiro Niimi*

TL;DR: 研究探讨了大规模语言模型(LLM)在生成参考文献时的幻觉问题，发现引用计数与准确性密切相关，并揭示了记忆干扰现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM在生成参考文献时出现的幻觉问题，探究引用频率对准确性及记忆化程度的影响。

Method: 使用GPT-4.1生成100条计算机科学领域的引用，并通过余弦相似度验证生成和真实元数据的一致性。

Result: 引用计数与事实准确性高度相关；引用超过约1000次时，参考文献信息几乎被逐字记忆；发现记忆干扰现象。

Conclusion: LLM在生成参考文献时存在从泛化到记忆化的阈值，高引用论文几乎被逐字保留在模型中。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly applied to a wide range of tasks, from natural language understanding to code generation. While they have also been used to assist in citation recommendation, the hallucination of non-existent papers remains a major issue. Building on prior studies, this study hypothesizes that an LLM's ability to correctly produce bibliographic records depends on whether the underlying knowledge is generated or memorized, with highly cited papers (i.e., more frequently appear in the pretraining corpus) showing lower hallucination rates. We therefore assume citation count as a proxy for training data redundancy (i.e., the frequency with which a given bibliographic record appears in the pretraining corpus) and investigate how citation frequency affects hallucinated references in LLM outputs. Using GPT-4.1, we generated and manually verified 100 citations across twenty computer-science domains, and measured factual consistency via cosine similarity between generated and authentic metadata. The results revealed that (i) citation count is strongly correlated with factual accuracy, (ii) bibliographic information becomes almost verbatim memorized beyond roughly 1,000 citations, and (iii) memory interference occurs when multiple highly cited papers share similar content. These findings indicate a threshold where generalization shifts into memorization, with highly cited papers being nearly verbatim retained in the model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型生成幻觉内容的问题，提高其输出的可信度。

Method: 提出HalluClean框架，采用规划、执行和修订的三阶段推理增强范式，并通过任务无关的提示实现零样本跨领域泛化。

Result: 在五项代表性任务中，HalluClean显著提升了事实一致性，并优于竞争基线方法。

Conclusion: HalluClean有潜力提升大语言模型在实际应用中的可信度。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks, yet they often produce hallucinated content that undermines factual reliability. To address this challenge, we introduce HalluClean, a lightweight and task-agnostic framework for detecting and correcting hallucinations in LLM-generated text. HalluClean adopts a reasoning-enhanced paradigm, explicitly decomposing the process into planning, execution, and revision stages to identify and refine unsupported claims. It employs minimal task-routing prompts to enable zero-shot generalization across diverse domains, without relying on external knowledge sources or supervised detectors. We conduct extensive evaluations on five representative tasks-question answering, dialogue, summarization, math word problems, and contradiction detection. Experimental results show that HalluClean significantly improves factual consistency and outperforms competitive baselines, demonstrating its potential to enhance the trustworthiness of LLM outputs in real-world applications.

Conclusion: TiDAR首次在质量上与自回归模型相当的同时，显著提升了生成效率，为语言模型设计提供了新方向。

Abstract: Diffusion language models hold the promise of fast parallel generation, while autoregressive (AR) models typically excel in quality due to their causal structure aligning naturally with language modeling. This raises a fundamental question: can we achieve a synergy with high throughput, higher GPU utilization, and AR level quality? Existing methods fail to effectively balance these two aspects, either prioritizing AR using a weaker model for sequential drafting (speculative decoding), leading to lower drafting efficiency, or using some form of left-to-right (AR-like) decoding logic for diffusion, which still suffers from quality degradation and forfeits its potential parallelizability. We introduce TiDAR, a sequence-level hybrid architecture that drafts tokens (Thinking) in Diffusion and samples final outputs (Talking) AutoRegressively - all within a single forward pass using specially designed structured attention masks. This design exploits the free GPU compute density, achieving a strong balance between drafting and verification capacity. Moreover, TiDAR is designed to be serving-friendly (low overhead) as a standalone model. We extensively evaluate TiDAR against AR models, speculative decoding, and diffusion variants across generative and likelihood tasks at 1.5B and 8B scales. Thanks to the parallel drafting and sampling as well as exact KV cache support, TiDAR outperforms speculative decoding in measured throughput and surpasses diffusion models like Dream and Llada in both efficiency and quality. Most notably, TiDAR is the first architecture to close the quality gap with AR models while delivering 4.71x to 5.91x more tokens per second.

Conclusion: EVADE框架展示了LLM在规模化错误检测和提升数据集质量方面的潜力，降低了人工成本。

Abstract: High-quality datasets are critical for training and evaluating reliable NLP models. In tasks like natural language inference (NLI), human label variation (HLV) arises when multiple labels are valid for the same instance, making it difficult to separate annotation errors from plausible variation. An earlier framework VARIERR (Weber-Genzel et al., 2024) asks multiple annotators to explain their label decisions in the first round and flag errors via validity judgments in the second round. However, conducting two rounds of manual annotation is costly and may limit the coverage of plausible labels or explanations. Our study proposes a new framework, EVADE, for generating and validating explanations to detect errors using large language models (LLMs). We perform a comprehensive analysis comparing human- and LLM-detected errors for NLI across distribution comparison, validation overlap, and impact on model fine-tuning. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM validation refines generated explanation distributions to more closely align with human annotations, and that removing LLM-detected errors from training data yields improvements in fine-tuning performance than removing errors identified by human annotators. This highlights the potential to scale error detection, reducing human effort while improving dataset quality under label variation.

Conclusion: SpiralThinker将迭代计算与潜在推理结合，表明对齐的迭代更新可以可靠地指导潜在空间中的推理。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models have been driven by reinforcement learning and test-time scaling, accompanied by growing interest in latent rather than purely textual reasoning. However, existing latent reasoning methods lack mechanisms to ensure stable evolution of latent representations and a systematic way to interleave implicit and explicit reasoning. We introduce SpiralThinker, a unified framework that performs iterative updates over latent representations, enabling extended implicit reasoning without generating additional tokens. A progressive alignment objective combined with structured annotations maintains coherence between latent and textual reasoning. Across mathematical, logical, and commonsense reasoning tasks, SpiralThinker achieves the best overall performance among latent reasoning approaches, consistently surpassing previous methods across all benchmarks. Detailed analyses reveal that both iteration and alignment are indispensable, the numbers of latent tokens and iterations exhibit dataset-specific optima, and appropriate alignment proves critical for an effective iterative process. Overall, SpiralThinker bridges iterative computation and latent reasoning, demonstrating that aligned iterative updates can reliably steer reasoning in the latent space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估方法多基于静态对话，难以捕捉情感支持的动态性和长期性，因此需要新的评估方式和指标。

Method: 通过构建包含328个情感背景和1,152个干扰事件的大规模基准，约束模型输出并使用因果调整情感估计方法，提出三个轨迹级指标（BEL、ETV、ECP）。

Result: 研究揭示了不同大语言模型在情感支持能力上的显著差异，并提供了模型改进的实际建议。

Conclusion: 提出的轨迹评估框架为大语言模型在情感支持领域的长期表现提供了全面分析工具，指明了未来优化的方向。

Abstract: Emotional support is a core capability in human-AI interaction, with applications including psychological counseling, role play, and companionship. However, existing evaluations of large language models (LLMs) often rely on short, static dialogues and fail to capture the dynamic and long-term nature of emotional support. To overcome this limitation, we shift from snapshot-based evaluation to trajectory-based assessment, adopting a user-centered perspective that evaluates models based on their ability to improve and stabilize user emotional states over time. Our framework constructs a large-scale benchmark consisting of 328 emotional contexts and 1,152 disturbance events, simulating realistic emotional shifts under evolving dialogue scenarios. To encourage psychologically grounded responses, we constrain model outputs using validated emotion regulation strategies such as situation selection and cognitive reappraisal. User emotional trajectories are modeled as a first-order Markov process, and we apply causally-adjusted emotion estimation to obtain unbiased emotional state tracking. Based on this framework, we introduce three trajectory-level metrics: Baseline Emotional Level (BEL), Emotional Trajectory Volatility (ETV), and Emotional Centroid Position (ECP). These metrics collectively capture user emotional dynamics over time and support comprehensive evaluation of long-term emotional support performance of LLMs. Extensive evaluations across a diverse set of LLMs reveal significant disparities in emotional support capabilities and provide actionable insights for model development.

Conclusion: 提出的框架能够有效解决LLM在受监管领域中的可靠性和逻辑正确性问题，生成可验证的审计结果。

Abstract: Large Language Models perform well at natural language interpretation and reasoning, but their inherent stochasticity limits their adoption in regulated industries like finance and healthcare that operate under strict policies. To address this limitation, we present a two-stage neurosymbolic framework that (1) uses LLMs with optional human guidance to formalize natural language policies, allowing fine-grained control of the formalization process, and (2) uses inference-time autoformalization to validate logical correctness of natural language statements against those policies. When correctness is paramount, we perform multiple redundant formalization steps at inference time, cross checking the formalizations for semantic equivalence. Our benchmarks demonstrate that our approach exceeds 99% soundness, indicating a near-zero false positive rate in identifying logical validity. Our approach produces auditable logical artifacts that substantiate the verification outcomes and can be used to improve the original text.

Abstract: The ability of critique is vital for models to self-improve and serve as reliable AI assistants. While extensively studied in language-only settings, multimodal critique of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) remains underexplored despite their growing capabilities in tasks like captioning and visual reasoning. In this work, we introduce MM-CRITIC, a holistic benchmark for evaluating the critique ability of LMMs across multiple dimensions: basic, correction, and comparison. Covering 8 main task types and over 500 tasks, MM-CRITIC collects responses from various LMMs with different model sizes and is composed of 4471 samples. To enhance the evaluation reliability, we integrate expert-informed ground answers into scoring rubrics that guide GPT-4o in annotating responses and generating reference critiques, which serve as anchors for trustworthy judgments. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MM-CRITIC and provide a comprehensive assessment of leading LMMs' critique capabilities under multiple dimensions. Further analysis reveals some key insights, including the correlation between response quality and critique, and varying critique difficulty across evaluation dimensions.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a streaming speech recognition framework for Amdo Tibetan, built upon a hybrid CTC/Atten-tion architecture with a context-aware dynamic chunking mechanism. The proposed strategy adaptively adjusts chunk widths based on encoding states, enabling flexible receptive fields, cross-chunk information exchange, and robust adaptation to varying speaking rates, thereby alleviating the context truncation problem of fixed-chunk methods. To further capture the linguistic characteristics of Tibetan, we construct a lexicon grounded in its orthographic principles, providing linguistically motivated modeling units. During decoding, an external language model is integrated to enhance semantic consistency and improve recognition of long sentences. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieves a word error rate (WER) of 6.23% on the test set, yielding a 48.15% relative improvement over the fixed-chunk baseline, while significantly reducing recognition latency and maintaining performance close to global decoding.

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has proven to be effective in mitigating hallucinations in large language models, yet its effectiveness remains limited in complex, multi-step reasoning scenarios.Recent efforts have incorporated search-based interactions into RAG, enabling iterative reasoning with real-time retrieval. Most approaches rely on outcome-based supervision, offering no explicit guidance for intermediate steps. This often leads to reward hacking and degraded response quality. We propose Bi-RAR, a novel retrieval-augmented reasoning framework that evaluates each intermediate step jointly in both forward and backward directions. To assess the information completeness of each step, we introduce a bidirectional information distance grounded in Kolmogorov complexity, approximated via language model generation probabilities. This quantification measures both how far the current reasoning is from the answer and how well it addresses the question. To optimize reasoning under these bidirectional signals, we adopt a multi-objective reinforcement learning framework with a cascading reward structure that emphasizes early trajectory alignment. Empirical results on seven question answering benchmarks demonstrate that Bi-RAR surpasses previous methods and enables efficient interaction and reasoning with the search engine during training and inference.

Result: LLMs在生成幽默方面表现介于人类低到中等水平，但极度缺乏同理心，且其评估标准（注重新颖性）与人类（注重同理心）存在显著差异。

Abstract: Computational humor is a frontier for creating advanced and engaging natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as sophisticated dialogue systems. While previous studies have benchmarked the humor capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), they have often relied on single-dimensional evaluations, such as judging whether something is simply ``funny.'' This paper argues that a multifaceted understanding of humor is necessary and addresses this gap by systematically evaluating LLMs through the lens of Oogiri, a form of Japanese improvisational comedy games. To achieve this, we expanded upon existing Oogiri datasets with data from new sources and then augmented the collection with Oogiri responses generated by LLMs. We then manually annotated this expanded collection with 5-point absolute ratings across six dimensions: Novelty, Clarity, Relevance, Intelligence, Empathy, and Overall Funniness. Using this dataset, we assessed the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs on two core tasks: their ability to generate creative Oogiri responses and their ability to evaluate the funniness of responses using a six-dimensional evaluation. Our results show that while LLMs can generate responses at a level between low- and mid-tier human performance, they exhibit a notable lack of Empathy. This deficit in Empathy helps explain their failure to replicate human humor assessment. Correlation analyses of human and model evaluation data further reveal a fundamental divergence in evaluation criteria: LLMs prioritize Novelty, whereas humans prioritize Empathy. We release our annotated corpus to the community to pave the way for the development of more emotionally intelligent and sophisticated conversational agents.

Abstract: Personalized learning has gained attention in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) education, where engagement and motivation play crucial roles in reading comprehension. We propose a novel approach to generating personalized English reading comprehension tests tailored to students' interests. We develop a structured content transcreation pipeline using OpenAI's gpt-4o, where we start with the RACE-C dataset, and generate new passages and multiple-choice reading comprehension questions that are linguistically similar to the original passages but semantically aligned with individual learners' interests. Our methodology integrates topic extraction, question classification based on Bloom's taxonomy, linguistic feature analysis, and content transcreation to enhance student engagement. We conduct a controlled experiment with EFL learners in South Korea to examine the impact of interest-aligned reading materials on comprehension and motivation. Our results show students learning with personalized reading passages demonstrate improved comprehension and motivation retention compared to those learning with non-personalized materials.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RoPE在Transformer模型中存在长度外推的固有局限性，削弱了模型的泛化能力。

Method: 通过将注意力图与位置编码重新解释为噪声特征图，利用截断矩阵熵检测异常频带，并通过无参数高斯分布重新参数化特征图以实现稳健外推。

Result: 在长序列任务（如大海捞针和多次上下文学习）中，DoPE显著提高了检索准确性和推理稳定性（可达64K tokens长度）。

Conclusion: DoPE通过去噪策略有效缓解了注意力下沉问题，恢复了平衡的注意力模式，为长度泛化提供了简单而强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) in Transformer models has inherent limits that weaken length extrapolation. We reinterpret the attention map with positional encoding as a noisy feature map, and propose Denoising Positional Encoding (DoPE), a training-free method based on truncated matrix entropy to detect outlier frequency bands in the feature map. Leveraging the noise characteristics of the feature map, we further reparameterize it with a parameter-free Gaussian distribution to achieve robust extrapolation. Our method theoretically reveals the underlying cause of the attention sink phenomenon and its connection to truncated matrix entropy. Experiments on needle-in-a-haystack and many-shot in-context learning tasks demonstrate that DoPE significantly improves retrieval accuracy and reasoning stability across extended contexts (up to 64K tokens). The results show that the denoising strategy for positional embeddings effectively mitigates attention sinks and restores balanced attention patterns, providing a simple yet powerful solution for improving length generalization.

Abstract: Augmenting Large Language Models (LLMs) with external tools enables them to execute complex, multi-step tasks. However, tool learning is hampered by the static synthetic data pipelines where data generation and model training are executed as two separate, non-interactive processes. This approach fails to adaptively focus on a model's specific weaknesses and allows noisy labels to persist, degrading training efficiency. We introduce LoopTool, a fully automated, model-aware data evolution framework that closes this loop by tightly integrating data synthesis and model training. LoopTool iteratively refines both the data and the model through three synergistic modules: (1) Greedy Capability Probing (GCP) diagnoses the model's mastered and failed capabilities; (2) Judgement-Guided Label Verification (JGLV) uses an open-source judge model to find and correct annotation errors, progressively purifying the dataset; and (3) Error-Driven Data Expansion (EDDE) generates new, challenging samples based on identified failures. This closed-loop process operates within a cost-effective, open-source ecosystem, eliminating dependence on expensive closed-source APIs. Experiments show that our 8B model trained with LoopTool significantly surpasses its 32B data generator and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the BFCL-v3 and ACEBench benchmarks for its scale. Our work demonstrates that closed-loop, self-refining data pipelines can dramatically enhance the tool-use capabilities of LLMs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型在表格问题回答中直接处理复杂表格结构时表现不佳的问题。

Method: 结合语言模型和TF-IDF的混合检索机制，通过对比学习训练模型，选择最相关的单元格作为答案。

Result: 在NTCIR-18的TQA数据集上达到74.6%的准确率，优于GPT-4o mini（63.9%）。

Conclusion: 未来将引入更高效的文本搜索模型以进一步提升性能，缩小与人工评估结果的差距。

Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) are gaining increased attention in the domain of Table Question Answering (TQA), particularly for extracting information from tables in documents. However, directly entering entire tables as long text into LLMs often leads to incorrect answers because most LLMs cannot inherently capture complex table structures. In this paper, we propose a cell extraction method for TQA without manual identification, even for complex table headers. Our approach estimates table headers by computing similarities between a given question and individual cells via a hybrid retrieval mechanism that integrates a language model and TF-IDF. We then select as the answer the cells at the intersection of the most relevant row and column. Furthermore, the language model is trained using contrastive learning on a small dataset of question-header pairs to enhance performance. We evaluated our approach in the TQA dataset from the U4 shared task at NTCIR-18. The experimental results show that our pipeline achieves an accuracy of 74.6\%, outperforming existing LLMs such as GPT-4o mini~(63.9\%). In the future, although we used traditional encoder models for retrieval in this study, we plan to incorporate more efficient text-search models to improve performance and narrow the gap with human evaluation results.

Abstract: Recent work has proposed using Large Language Models (LLMs) to quantify narrative flow through a measure called sequentiality, which combines topic and contextual terms. A recent critique argued that the original results were confounded by how topics were selected for the topic-based component, and noted that the metric had not been validated against ground-truth measures of flow. That work proposed using only the contextual term as a more conceptually valid and interpretable alternative. In this paper, we empirically validate that proposal. Using two essay datasets with human-annotated trait scores, ASAP++ and ELLIPSE, we show that the contextual version of sequentiality aligns more closely with human assessments of discourse-level traits such as Organization and Cohesion. While zero-shot prompted LLMs predict trait scores more accurately than the contextual measure alone, the contextual measure adds more predictive value than both the topic-only and original sequentiality formulations when combined with standard linguistic features. Notably, this combination also outperforms the zero-shot LLM predictions, highlighting the value of explicitly modeling sentence-to-sentence flow. Our findings support the use of context-based sequentiality as a validated, interpretable, and complementary feature for automated essay scoring and related NLP tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型在训练过程中动态优化子词分割的学习动态，以及子词如何在预训练和微调中演变。

Method: 扩展子词分段语言模型（SSLM）框架，支持预训练和微调，并在三种不同形态类型的语言（isi-Xhosa、Setswana、英语）上训练模型。

Result: 形态复杂的isi-Xhosa表现出更大的不稳定性，子词边界在微调过程中变得更细粒度；可学习的子词分割为低资源、形态复杂的语言提供了改进文本生成和跨语言迁移的潜力。

Conclusion: 动态学习的子词分割对形态复杂的语言具有重要价值，未来可进一步优化其在低资源语言中的应用。

Abstract: Subword segmentation is typically applied in preprocessing and stays fixed during training. Alternatively, it can be learned during training to optimise the training objective. In this paper we study the learning dynamics of subword segmentation: if a language model can dynamically optimise tokenisation, how do its subwords evolve during pretraining and finetuning? To explore this, we extend the subword segmental language model (SSLM), a framework for learning subwords during training, to support pretraining and finetuning. We train models for three typologically diverse languages to study learning dynamics across the morphological spectrum: Isi-Xhosa is conjunctive (long word forms composed of many morphemes), Setswana is disjunctive (morphemes written as separate words), and English represents a typological middle ground. We analyse subword dynamics from a linguistic perspective, tracking morphology, productivity, and fertility. We identify four stages of subword learning, with the morphologically complex isi-Xhosa exhibiting greater instability. During finetuning, subword boundaries shift to become finer-grained. Lastly, we show that learnable subwords offers a promising approach to improve text generation and cross-lingual transfer for low-resource, morphologically complex languages.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has recently emerged as a promising framework for aligning language models with complex reasoning objectives. However, most existing methods optimize only for final task outcomes, leaving models vulnerable to collapse when negative rewards dominate early training. This challenge is especially pronounced in honesty alignment, where models must not only solve answerable queries but also identify when conclusions cannot be drawn from the given premises. Deductive reasoning provides an ideal testbed because it isolates reasoning capability from reliance on external factual knowledge. To investigate honesty alignment, we curate two multi-step deductive reasoning datasets from graph structures, one for linear algebra and one for logical inference, and introduce unanswerable cases by randomly perturbing an edge in half of the instances. We find that GRPO, with or without supervised fine tuning initialization, struggles on these tasks. Through extensive experiments across three models, we evaluate stabilization strategies and show that curriculum learning provides some benefit but requires carefully designed in distribution datasets with controllable difficulty. To address these limitations, we propose Anchor, a reinforcement learning method that injects ground truth trajectories into rollouts, preventing early training collapse. Our results demonstrate that this method stabilizes learning and significantly improves the overall reasoning performance, underscoring the importance of training dynamics for enabling reliable deductive reasoning in aligned language models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语音大语言模型在多语言语音到文本翻译中忽略了不同源语言之间的语义共性，导致翻译性能偏差。POTSA旨在通过跨语言平行语音对和OT技术，弥合高低资源语言之间的翻译差距。

Method: 1. 提出偏差补偿模块，粗略地对齐不同语言的初始语音表示；2. 使用平行语音对对Q-Former施加令牌级OT约束，建立细粒度表示一致性；3. 采用分层调度策略，将OT约束集中在语义最有益的层上。

Result: 在FLEURS数据集上的实验表明，POTSA实现了最优性能，在五种常见语言上平均BLEU提升0.93，在零样本语言上提升5.05，且每个源语言仅需10小时平行语音数据。

Conclusion: POTSA通过结合偏差补偿模块、OT约束和分层调度策略，显著提升了多语言语音到文本翻译的性能，尤其在低资源语言上表现突出。

Abstract: Speech Large Language Models (SpeechLLMs) have achieved breakthroughs in multilingual speech-to-text translation (S2TT). However, existing approaches often overlook semantic commonalities across source languages, leading to biased translation performance. In this work, we propose \textbf{POTSA} (Parallel Optimal Transport for Speech Alignment), a new framework based on cross-lingual parallel speech pairs and Optimal Transport (OT), designed to bridge high- and low-resource translation gaps. First, we introduce a Bias Compensation module to coarsely align initial speech representations across languages. Second, we impose token-level OT constraints on a Q-Former using parallel speech pairs to establish fine-grained consistency of representations. Then, we apply a layer scheduling strategy to focus OT constraints on the most semantically beneficial layers. Experiments on the FLEURS dataset show that our method achieves SOTA performance, with +0.93 BLEU on average over five common languages and +5.05 BLEU on zero-shot languages, using only 10 hours of parallel speech per source language.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为 C$^3$TG 的两阶段框架，用于细粒度的多维度文本属性控制，通过动态选择和优化解决属性冲突，显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以在不修改模型架构或大量微调的情况下实现多属性文本生成控制，且缺乏解决属性冲突的机制。

Method: C$^3$TG 分两阶段：生成阶段通过加权 KL 散度调整 token 概率，优化阶段通过能量函数和迭代反馈解决属性冲突。

Result: 实验表明，C$^3$TG 在属性准确性、语言流畅性和输出多样性等指标上显著优于基线，同时降低毒性。

Conclusion: C$^3$TG 是一种无需修改模型的高效多维度文本控制解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable text generation capabilities. However, controlling specific attributes of generated text remains challenging without architectural modifications or extensive fine-tuning. Current methods typically toggle a single, basic attribute but struggle with precise multi-attribute control. In scenarios where attribute requirements conflict, existing methods lack coordination mechanisms, causing interference between desired attributes. Furthermore, these methods fail to incorporate iterative optimization processes in the controlled generation pipeline. To address these limitations, we propose Conflict-aware, Composite, and Collaborative Controlled Text Generation (C$^3$TG), a two-phase framework for fine-grained, multi-dimensional text attribute control. During generation, C$^3$TG selectively pairs the LLM with the required attribute classifiers from the 17 available dimensions and employs weighted KL-divergence to adjust token probabilities. The optimization phase then leverages an energy function combining classifier scores and penalty terms to resolve attribute conflicts through iterative feedback, enabling precise control over multiple dimensions simultaneously while preserving natural text flow. Experiments show that C$^3$TG significantly outperforms baselines across multiple metrics including attribute accuracy, linguistic fluency, and output diversity, while simultaneously reducing toxicity. These results establish C$^3$TG as an effective and flexible solution for multi-dimensional text attribute control that requires no costly model modifications.

Result: 发现用户偏好差异大，微调模型对个人和群体偏好的建模准确率较高，但自述偏好效果有限。

Conclusion: LiteraryTaste数据集为个性化创意写作技术奠定了基础。

Abstract: People have different creative writing preferences, and large language models (LLMs) for these tasks can benefit from adapting to each user's preferences. However, these models are often trained over a dataset that considers varying personal tastes as a monolith. To facilitate developing personalized creative writing LLMs, we introduce LiteraryTaste, a dataset of reading preferences from 60 people, where each person: 1) self-reported their reading habits and tastes (stated preference), and 2) annotated their preferences over 100 pairs of short creative writing texts (revealed preference). With our dataset, we found that: 1) people diverge on creative writing preferences, 2) finetuning a transformer encoder could achieve 75.8% and 67.7% accuracy when modeling personal and collective revealed preferences, and 3) stated preferences had limited utility in modeling revealed preferences. With an LLM-driven interpretability pipeline, we analyzed how people's preferences vary. We hope our work serves as a cornerstone for personalizing creative writing technologies.

Abstract: Khmer polarity classification is a fundamental natural language processing task that assigns a positive, negative, or neutral label to a given Khmer text input. Existing Khmer models typically predict the label without explaining the rationale behind the prediction. This paper proposes an explainable Khmer polarity classifier by fine-tuning an instruction-based reasoning Qwen-3 model. The notion of explainability in this paper is limited to self-explanations, which the model uses to rationalize its predictions. Experimental results show that the fine-tuned model not only predicts labels accurately but also provides reasoning by identifying polarity-related keywords or phrases to support its predictions. In addition, we contribute a new Khmer polarity dataset consisting of short- to medium-length casual, romanized, and mixed-code Khmer expressions. This dataset was constructed using both heuristic rules and human curation and is publicly available through a gated Hugging Face repository (rinabuoy/khmerpolarity_nonreasoning). The fine-tuned Qwen-3 models are also made available in the same Hugging Face account.

Conclusion: AdaptDel方法通过动态调整删除率和扩展的理论框架，显著提升了序列分类在编辑距离扰动下的认证鲁棒性。

Abstract: We consider the problem of certified robustness for sequence classification against edit distance perturbations. Naturally occurring inputs of varying lengths (e.g., sentences in natural language processing tasks) present a challenge to current methods that employ fixed-rate deletion mechanisms and lead to suboptimal performance. To this end, we introduce AdaptDel methods with adaptable deletion rates that dynamically adjust based on input properties. We extend the theoretical framework of randomized smoothing to variable-rate deletion, ensuring sound certification with respect to edit distance. We achieve strong empirical results in natural language tasks, observing up to 30 orders of magnitude improvement to median cardinality of the certified region, over state-of-the-art certifications.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在多模态推理基准测试中表现良好，但未能区分真实推理能力与模式匹配，因此引入了mmJEE-Eval以填补这一空白。

Method: mmJEE-Eval包含来自JEE Advanced考试的1460个双语问题，涵盖了物理、化学和数学领域，并评估了17种前沿和开源模型的性能。

Result: 前沿模型（如GPT-5、Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash）在2025年问题上达到77-84%的准确率，而开源模型仅为37-45%。封闭模型在复杂推理任务中表现明显下滑。

Conclusion: mmJEE-Eval成功区分了优秀训练与推理方法与其他方法的差异，揭示了模型在深度推理任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Contemporary vision-language models (VLMs) perform well on existing multimodal reasoning benchmarks (78-85\% accuracy on MMMU, MathVista). Yet, these results fail to sufficiently distinguish true scientific reasoning articulation capabilities from pattern-matching. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{mmJEE-Eval}, a multimodal bilingual (English and Hindi) benchmark comprising 1,460 questions from India's JEE Advanced examination (2019-2025) spanning pre-college Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics domains. Our evaluation of 17 state-of-the-art models reveals that while frontier VLMs (GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro/Flash) achieve 77-84\% accuracy on held-out 2025 questions, open-source models plateau at 37-45\% despite scaling to 400B parameters, a significant difference not observed on existing benchmarks. While closed frontiers from Google and OpenAI show high problem-solving accuracies (up to 100\% pass@3 scores), they fully collapse when the reasoning load is increased meta-cognitively (GPT-5 fixes just 5.2\% errors). Systematic ablations show mmJEE-Eval's difficulty stems from complexity and reasoning depth rather than memorization. Effectively, our benchmark segregates superior training and reasoning methodologies where alternatives fail. We publicly release our code and data: https://mmjee-eval.github.io

Method: 利用快速的System 1计算查询的答案熵，动态评估样本扩展潜力，并在System 2中实现动态自一致性。

Result: 并行生成显著降低延迟，减少47%的token消耗和43%的推理延迟，性能无明显损失。

Conclusion: SeerSC框架有效平衡token效率与延迟，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Test-time scaling improves the inference performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) but also incurs substantial computational costs. Although recent studies have reduced token consumption through dynamic self-consistency, they remain constrained by the high latency of sequential requests. In this paper, we propose SeerSC, a dynamic self-consistency framework that simultaneously improves token efficiency and latency by integrating System 1 and System 2 reasoning. Specifically, we utilize the rapid System 1 to compute the answer entropy for given queries. This score is then used to evaluate the potential of samples for scaling, enabling dynamic self-consistency under System 2. Benefiting from the advance and accurate estimation provided by System 1, the proposed method can reduce token usage while simultaneously achieving a significant decrease in latency through parallel generation. It outperforms existing methods, achieving up to a 47% reduction in token consumption and a 43% reduction in inference latency without significant performance loss.

Abstract: We present Spider4SSC dataset and S2CLite parsing tool. S2CLite is a lightweight, ontology-agnostic parser that translates SPARQL queries into Cypher queries, enabling both in-situ and large-scale SPARQL to Cypher translation. Unlike existing solutions, S2CLite is purely rule-based (inspired by traditional programming language compilers) and operates without requiring an RDF graph or external tools. Experiments conducted on the BSBM42 and Spider4SPARQL datasets show that S2CLite significantly reduces query parsing errors, achieving a total parsing accuracy of 77.8% on Spider4SPARQL compared to 44.2% by the state-of-the-art S2CTrans. Furthermore, S2CLite achieved a 96.6\% execution accuracy on the intersecting subset of queries parsed by both parsers, outperforming S2CTrans by 7.3%. We further use S2CLite to parse Spider4SPARQL queries to Cypher and generate Spider4SSC, a unified Text-to-Query language (SQL, SPARQL, Cypher) dataset with 4525 unique questions and 3 equivalent sets of 2581 matching queries (SQL, SPARQL and Cypher).

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) for evaluating outputs is becoming an increasingly effective and scalable approach. However, it remains uncertain whether this capability extends beyond task-specific evaluations to more general assessments of text quality, particularly in multilingual contexts. In this study, we introduce, MTQ-Eval, a novel framework for multilingual text quality evaluation that learns from examples of both high- and low-quality texts, adjusting its internal representations. To develop MTQ-Eval, we first automatically generate text quality preference data and then use it to train open-source base LLMs to align with ratings of high- and low-quality text. Our comprehensive evaluation across 115 languages demonstrates the improved performance of the proposed model. Upon further analysis, we find that this enhanced evaluation capability also leads to notable improvements in downstream tasks.

Abstract: Large language models have recently demonstrated remarkable abilities to self-correct their responses through iterative refinement, often referred to as self-consistency or self-reflection. However, the dynamics of this self-correction mechanism may differ substantially depending on whether the model is tasked with open-ended text generation or with selecting the most appropriate response from multiple predefined options. In this paper, we conduct a systematic investigation of these two paradigms by comparing performance trends and error-correction behaviors across various natural language understanding and reasoning tasks, covering language models of different scales and families. Our experimental results reveal distinct patterns of improvement and failure modes:
  \textit{While open-ended generation often benefits from the flexibility of re-interpretation and compositional refinement, multiple-choice selection can leverage clearer solution boundaries but may be limited by the provided options}. This contrast also reflects the dual demands faced by emerging agentic LLM applications: effective agents must not only generate and refine open-ended plans or explanations, but also make reliable discrete choices when operating within constrained action spaces. Our findings, therefore, highlight that the design of self-correction mechanisms should take into account the interaction between task structure and output space, with implications for both knowledge-intensive reasoning and decision-oriented applications of LLMs.

*Ruibo Deng,Duanyu Feng,Wenqiang Lei*

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: AMaPO提出了一种自适应边界优化方法，解决了离线偏好优化中的过拟合与欠拟合问题，显著提升了排序准确性和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线偏好优化方法依赖排序准确性，但当前边界设计导致过拟合（正确样本梯度浪费）和欠拟合（错误样本信号不足）。

Method: 提出AMaPO算法，通过Z归一化和指数缩放的自适应边界，动态调整学习梯度分配：增强错误样本梯度，抑制正确样本梯度。

Result: 实验显示AMaPO在排序准确性和下游任务对齐性能上均表现更优，有效缓解了过拟合与欠拟合问题。

Conclusion: AMaPO通过自适应边界设计，显著提升了离线偏好优化的效果，解决了核心的梯度分配问题。

Abstract: Offline preference optimization offers a simpler and more stable alternative to RLHF for aligning language models. However, their effectiveness is critically dependent on ranking accuracy, a metric where further gains are highly impactful. This limitation arises from a fundamental problem that we identify and formalize as the Overfitting-Underfitting Dilemma: current margin designs cause models to apply excessive, wasteful gradients to correctly ranked samples (overfitting) while providing insufficient corrective signals for misranked ones (underfitting). To resolve this dilemma, we propose Adaptive Margin-attached Preference Optimization (AMaPO), a simple yet principled algorithm. AMaPO employs an instance-wise adaptive margin, refined by Z-normalization and exponential scaling, which dynamically reallocates learning effort by amplifying gradients for misranked samples and suppressing them for correct ones. Extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks demonstrate that AMaPO not only achieves better ranking accuracy and superior downstream alignment performance, but targeted analysis also confirms that it successfully mitigates the core overfitting and underfitting issues.

Main category: cs.CL

TL;DR: 该研究旨在为低资源语言（巴斯克语）开发强大的多模态大语言模型（MLLM），通过构建自有训练和评估数据集，探索不同数据混合比例，发现仅需少量巴斯克语数据即可取得良好效果，且无需巴斯克语指令模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型（MLLM）在低资源语言中表现不佳，尤其是开放科学社区。研究旨在填补这一空白，为巴斯克语开发高性能MLLM。

Method: 使用Llama-3.1-Instruct和巴斯克语变体Latxa作为骨干模型，构建自有图像-文本数据集，探索不同数据混合比例进行训练。

Result: 仅需20%巴斯克语多模态数据即可在巴斯克语基准测试中取得良好效果；无需巴斯克语指令模型即可开发强巴斯克语MLLM。

Conclusion: 研究成果为其他低资源语言的MLLM开发提供了借鉴，同时公开了资源以促进开放科学发展。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models exhibit very strong performance for several demanding tasks. While commercial MLLMs deliver acceptable performance in low-resource languages, comparable results remain unattained within the open science community. In this paper, we aim to develop a strong MLLM for a low-resource language, namely Basque. For that purpose, we develop our own training and evaluation image-text datasets. Using two different Large Language Models as backbones, the Llama-3.1-Instruct model and a Basque-adapted variant called Latxa, we explore several data mixtures for training. We show that: i) low ratios of Basque multimodal data (around 20%) are already enough to obtain solid results on Basque benchmarks, and ii) contrary to expected, a Basque instructed backbone LLM is not required to obtain a strong MLLM in Basque. Our results pave the way to develop MLLMs for other low-resource languages by openly releasing our resources.

Method: 提出CARE-Bench基准，基于真实心理咨询案例构建多样化客户档案，模拟动态交互，并采用心理学量表进行多维度评估。

Result: 评估了通用及专用心理咨询大语言模型，发现其局限性；并根据失败案例分析客户交互中的不足。

Conclusion: 研究为开发更全面、通用且有效的心理咨询模型提供了方向，强调动态、多维评估的重要性。

Abstract: The mismatch between the growing demand for psychological counseling and the limited availability of services has motivated research into the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this domain. Consequently, there is a need for a robust and unified benchmark to assess the counseling competence of various LLMs. Existing works, however, are limited by unprofessional client simulation, static question-and-answer evaluation formats, and unidimensional metrics. These limitations hinder their effectiveness in assessing a model's comprehensive ability to handle diverse and complex clients. To address this gap, we introduce \textbf{CARE-Bench}, a dynamic and interactive automated benchmark. It is built upon diverse client profiles derived from real-world counseling cases and simulated according to expert guidelines. CARE-Bench provides a multidimensional performance evaluation grounded in established psychological scales. Using CARE-Bench, we evaluate several general-purpose LLMs and specialized counseling models, revealing their current limitations. In collaboration with psychologists, we conduct a detailed analysis of the reasons for LLMs' failures when interacting with clients of different types, which provides directions for developing more comprehensive, universal, and effective counseling models.

Conclusion: GSAP-ERE数据集对推动学术信息提取领域的研究至关重要，显示出微调模型在当前任务中的优越性。

Abstract: Research in Machine Learning (ML) and AI evolves rapidly. Information Extraction (IE) from scientific publications enables to identify information about research concepts and resources on a large scale and therefore is a pathway to improve understanding and reproducibility of ML-related research. To extract and connect fine-grained information in ML-related research, e.g. method training and data usage, we introduce GSAP-ERE. It is a manually curated fine-grained dataset with 10 entity types and 18 semantically categorized relation types, containing mentions of 63K entities and 35K relations from the full text of 100 ML publications. We show that our dataset enables fine-tuned models to automatically extract information relevant for downstream tasks ranging from knowledge graph (KG) construction, to monitoring the computational reproducibility of AI research at scale. Additionally, we use our dataset as a test suite to explore prompting strategies for IE using Large Language Models (LLM). We observe that the performance of state-of-the-art LLM prompting methods is largely outperformed by our best fine-tuned baseline model (NER: 80.6%, RE: 54.0% for the fine-tuned model vs. NER: 44.4%, RE: 10.1% for the LLM). This disparity of performance between supervised models and unsupervised usage of LLMs suggests datasets like GSAP-ERE are needed to advance research in the domain of scholarly information extraction.

Abstract: Predicting an individual's personalities from their generated texts is a challenging task, especially when the text volume is large. In this paper, we introduce a straightforward yet effective novel strategy called targeted preselection of texts (TPoT). This method semantically filters the texts as input to a deep learning model, specifically designed to predict a Big Five personality trait, facet, or item, referred to as the BIG5-TPoT model. By selecting texts that are semantically relevant to a particular trait, facet, or item, this strategy not only addresses the issue of input text limits in large language models but also improves the Mean Absolute Error and accuracy metrics in predictions for the Stream of Consciousness Essays dataset.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将无约束英语翻译为ASP程序的新方法，用于解决逻辑谜题，结合了LLM和AMR图，简化了自然语言处理过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对不熟悉编程语言的用户需要与代码交互的需求，提出了一种更轻量级、可解释的系统，将自然语言转化为ASP程序以解决复杂逻辑问题。

Method: 利用LLM简化自然语言句子、识别关键词和生成简单事实，并结合AMR图解析简化语言，系统性地生成ASP约束条件，最终构建完整的ASP程序。

Result: 系统成功生成了解决组合逻辑问题的完整ASP程序，证明了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这种方法为实现自然语言转化为复杂逻辑问题解决方案提供了重要的第一步，具有轻量级和可解释性的优势。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a declarative programming paradigm based on logic programming and non-monotonic reasoning. It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.

Abstract: The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artificial General Intelligence (ARC-AGI) is a generative, few-shot fluid intelligence benchmark. Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的大型语言模型在教育中缺乏动态适应能力和对学生认知状态的实时感知，UCO旨在解决这一问题。

Method: UCO采用多轮交互式强化学习，设计了Progress Reward和Scaffold Reward两个奖励函数，以捕捉学生的认知进步和实时适应教学策略。

Result: 在BigMath和MathTutorBench基准测试中，UCO优于所有同等规模的基线模型，并与先进闭源模型性能相当。

Conclusion: UCO通过动态优化教学策略，显著提升了智能辅导系统的效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are shifting from answer providers to intelligent tutors in educational settings, yet current supervised fine-tuning methods only learn surface teaching patterns without dynamic adaptation capabilities. Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models. The code and data are available at https://github.com/Mind-Lab-ECNU/UCO.

Abstract: We introduce Lumine, the first open recipe for developing generalist agents capable of completing hours-long complex missions in real time within challenging 3D open-world environments. Lumine adopts a human-like interaction paradigm that unifies perception, reasoning, and action in an end-to-end manner, powered by a vision-language model. It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail. These promising results highlight Lumine's effectiveness across distinct worlds and interaction dynamics, marking a concrete step toward generalist agents in open-ended environments.

Motivation: 现有预测方法缺乏人类专家的互动、推理和适应性，限制了其在复杂现实环境中的实用性。AlphaCast旨在填补这一缺口。

Method: AlphaCast分为两阶段：(1)自动化预测准备，构建多维认知基础；(2)生成推理与反思优化，通过元推理循环实现持续自校正和策略优化。

Result: AlphaCast在短期和长期数据集上的实验显示，其预测准确性优于现有最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: AlphaCast通过人与LLM的协作，重新定义了预测任务，显著提升了复杂环境中的预测性能。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in high-stakes domains such as energy, healthcare, and climate. Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型（LLM）展现出极高的流畅性，但其推理能力仍需增强。研究旨在通过结构化方法优化LLM的推理过程。

Method: 采用多智能体管道结合递归细化（RR）方法，通过自评、对抗性测试和反馈整合实现GIS搜索。实验比较了简单管道与复杂管道的性能。

Result: 复杂模型在所有九个测试案例中表现优于简单模型，平均分数为88.3对71.7，论证更具分析深度和策略性。

Conclusion: 递归细化是增强LLM推理的强大架构特征，通过GIS搜索实现高质量推理。

Abstract: Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing. We conclude that recursive refinement is a robust architectural feature for enhancing LLM reasoning via GIS search.

Motivation: 自动驾驶系统在复杂驾驶场景中可能面临多种安全隐患，需要具备韧性和适应性以维持安全驾驶行为。

Method: 提出Argus框架，实时监测ADS的轨迹并识别潜在危险，通过危险缓解器在必要时接管控制。

Result: Argus显著提升了ADS的驾驶分数（平均150.30%）并减少违规行为（64.38%），且时间开销极小。

Conclusion: Argus有效增强了自动驾驶系统的韧性，为复杂场景下的安全驾驶提供了可行方案。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems (ADSs), with their strong capabilities in environmental perception and generalizable driving decisions, are attracting growing attention from both academia and industry. However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.
  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.

Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) are poised to revolutionize emergency services by enabling faster, safer, and more efficient responses. This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining. By reviewing the state of the art in AV intelligence, DM-augmented RL, and LLM-assisted ICL, this paper provides a critical framework for understanding the next generation of autonomous emergency response systems from a Generative AI perspective.

Result: OR-R1仅需1/10的合成数据即达到67.7%的平均求解准确率，比ORLM提升4.2%，并在100样本下仍优于ORLM 2.4%。TGRPO额外带来3.1%-6.4%的提升。

Conclusion: OR-R1为自动化OR优化问题建模与求解提供了高效、可扩展且低成本的解决方案，显著降低了工业应用的门槛。

Abstract: Optimization modeling and solving are fundamental to the application of Operations Research (OR) in real-world decision making, yet the process of translating natural language problem descriptions into formal models and solver code remains highly expertise intensive. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\%-6.4\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\%$ to $7\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大推理模型（LRMs）因过度思考导致冗余推理步骤和高计算成本的问题。

Method: 提出训练简洁性奖励模型（CRM）的流程，并设计简洁性奖励函数（CRF）以明确奖励与简洁性分数的关系。

Result: 在五个数学基准数据集上，实现了8.1%的准确率提升和19.9%的响应长度减少。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了模型的推理效率和准确性，并具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling the development of large reasoning models (LRMs). However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties. Besides, on the practical side, extensive experiments on five mathematical benchmark datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness and token efficiency, which achieves an 8.1% accuracy improvement and a 19.9% reduction in response token length on Qwen2.5-7B. Furthermore, the method generalizes well to other LLMs including Llama and Mistral. The implementation code and datasets are publicly available for reproduction: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CRM.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于增强自主AI系统可靠性的双层监控框架，以解决其在高风险领域中的不可靠性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主AI系统在减少外部控制的情况下工作，但其可靠性不足，尤其是在高风险领域中可能带来不可预测的行为，亟需缓解措施。

Method: 基于自主AI系统的特性，提出了一个双层可靠性监控框架，包括针对新输入的分布外检测层和揭示内部操作的AI透明度层。

Result: 该框架为人类操作员提供了决策支持，使其能够判断输出是否可靠并干预，从而降低操作中的可靠性风险。

Conclusion: 双层监控框架为减少自主AI系统在运行中的可靠性风险提供了基础，但仍需进一步开发缓解技术。

Abstract: The implementation of agentic AI systems has the potential of providing more helpful AI systems in a variety of applications. These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene. This framework provides a foundation for developing mitigation techniques to reduce risk stemming from uncertain reliability during operation.

*Yi-Hsien Hsieh,Ta-Jung Chien,Chun-Kai Huang,Shao-Hua Sun,Che Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedFuse是一种用于处理不规则临床时间序列的框架，通过乘法调制融合特征和值嵌入，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床时间序列数据具有不规则性、异步采样和缺失值等问题，现有嵌入方法难以捕捉特征间的高阶依赖关系。

Method: 提出MedFuse框架，核心是MuFuse模块，通过乘法调制融合特征和值的嵌入，保留特征特定信息并建模高阶依赖。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，MedFuse在关键预测任务上表现优于现有基线，且乘法融合增强了表示的表达能力。

Conclusion: MedFuse为建模不规则临床时间序列提供了通用且高效的方法。

Abstract: Clinical time series derived from electronic health records (EHRs) are inherently irregular, with asynchronous sampling, missing values, and heterogeneous feature dynamics. While numerical laboratory measurements are highly informative, existing embedding strategies usually combine feature identity and value embeddings through additive operations, which constrains their ability to capture value-dependent feature interactions. We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks. Analysis of the learned representations further demonstrates that multiplicative fusion enhances expressiveness and supports cross-dataset pretraining. These results establish MedFuse as a generalizable approach for modeling irregular clinical time series.

Result: 在四个真实交通数据集上的实验表明，HyperD在预测准确性、鲁棒性和计算效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HyperD是一个高效且稳健的交通预测框架，能够有效处理周期性模式和非周期性扰动。

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting plays a vital role in intelligent transportation systems, enabling applications such as congestion control, route planning, and urban mobility optimization.However, traffic forecasting remains challenging due to two key factors: (1) complex spatial dependencies arising from dynamic interactions between road segments and traffic sensors across the network, and (2) the coexistence of multi-scale periodic patterns (e.g., daily and weekly periodic patterns driven by human routines) with irregular fluctuations caused by unpredictable events (e.g., accidents, weather, or construction). To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出从‘模型训练’转向‘模型培养’的范式转变，将价值对齐从开发初期就融入模型之中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI训练方法仅在模型核心能力建立后才进行价值对齐，导致模型易出现偏差且缺乏深层次价值体系。

Method: 通过重新设计训练语料库，包括第一人称视角数据、信息情境化为生活体验、模拟社交互动以及训练数据顺序的阶段性安排。

Result: 预期能实现从第一个训练标记开始的早期价值承诺，使知识、技能和价值更难分离。

Conclusion: 在大语言模型能力逐渐超越人类的背景下，这种范式转变至关重要。

Abstract: Current AI training methods align models with human values only after their core capabilities have been established, resulting in models that are easily misaligned and lack deep-rooted value systems. We propose a paradigm shift from "model training" to "model raising", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate. In an ecosystem in which large language model capabilities start overtaking human capabilities in many tasks, this seems to us like a critical need.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在定量研究中取得了显著进展，但定性研究领域仍缺乏适合的工具，研究者不得不依赖通用AI工具（如ChatGPT）辅助研究，但这些工具存在偏见、不透明等问题，亟需开发针对定性研究的专用AI系统。

Method: 通过回顾近期文献，分析现有自动化科学发现管道的不足，提出增强定性功能的方法，并探讨如何开发透明、可重复且保护隐私的定性AI系统。

Result: 研究表明，现有的AI工具在定性研究中存在局限性，而开发专用的定性AI系统可以为多学科和混合方法研究提供更好的支持。

Conclusion: 定性AI系统的开发是填补当前研究空白的关键，这类系统需具备透明性、可重复性和隐私友好性，以推动科学研究的全面进步。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models (LLM) are reshaping science, with most recent advances culminating in fully-automated scientific discovery pipelines. But qualitative research has been left behind. Researchers in qualitative methods are hesitant about AI adoption. Yet when they are willing to use AI at all, they have little choice but to rely on general-purpose tools like ChatGPT to assist with interview interpretation, data annotation, and topic modeling - while simultaneously acknowledging these system's well-known limitations of being biased, opaque, irreproducible, and privacy-compromising. This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly. We review recent literature to show how existing automated discovery pipelines could be enhanced by robust qualitative capabilities, and identify key opportunities where safe qualitative AI could advance multidisciplinary and mixed-methods research.

Motivation: 评估当前前沿LLMs在规划和推理任务中的表现，比较其与专业规划器的差距，展示LLMs在这一领域的进展。

Method: 使用PDDL领域和任务描述对三种前沿LLM（GPT-5、DeepSeek R1、Gemini 2.5 Pro）进行端到端规划性能测试，并与LAMA规划器在部分国际规划竞赛领域对比。

Result: 标准PDDL任务中，GPT-5表现与LAMA相当；但在复杂推理任务中，所有LLMs性能下降，程度较此前模型更轻。

Conclusion: 前沿LLMs在规划和推理任务中性能显著提升，缩小了与专业规划器的差距，展示了LLMs在这一领域的潜力。

Abstract: The capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning remains an active area of research, with the capabilities of frontier models continually advancing. We provide an updated evaluation of the end-to-end planning performance of three frontier LLMs as of 2025, where models are prompted to generate a plan from PDDL domain and task descriptions. We evaluate DeepSeek R1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5 and as reference the planner LAMA on a subset of domains from the most recent Learning Track of the International Planning Competition. Our results show that on standard PDDL domains, the performance of GPT-5 in terms of solved tasks is competitive with LAMA. When the PDDL domains and tasks are obfuscated to test for pure reasoning, the performance of all LLMs degrades, though less severely than previously reported for other models. These results show substantial improvements over prior generations of LLMs, reducing the performance gap to planners on a challenging benchmark.

Abstract: Accessing information in learned representations is critical for scientific discovery in high-dimensional domains. We introduce a novel method based on latent flow matching with classifier-free guidance that disentangles latent subspaces by explicitly separating information included in conditioning from information that remains in the residual representation. Across three experiments -- a synthetic 2D Gaussian toy problem, colored MNIST, and the Galaxy10 astronomy dataset -- we show that our method enables access to meaningful features of high dimensional data. Our results highlight a simple yet powerful mechanism for analyzing, controlling, and repurposing latent representations, providing a pathway toward using generative models for scientific exploration of what we don't capture, consider, or catalog.

Conclusion: CrochetBench为评估多模态模型的程序能力提供了新视角，并揭示了现实创意领域中表面理解与可执行精度之间的差距。

Abstract: We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过聚合多个生成模型来增强AI安全性的方法，利用最安全的子集继承安全性，并通过共识采样算法实现风险控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI安全方法依赖于检查模型输出或激活，但某些风险仅靠检查无法发现。本文旨在提供一种架构无关的补充方法。

Method: 提出了一种共识采样算法，通过聚合多个生成模型的安全性，选择最安全的子集，并在模型间缺乏足够一致性时放弃输出。

Result: 算法能够将风险控制在最安全的子集的平均风险水平，同时在模型间一致性不足时选择放弃输出。

Conclusion: 该方法为AI安全提供了一种模型无关的新途径，通过放大模型集合中未知子集的安全性来增强整体安全性。

Abstract: Many approaches to AI safety rely on inspecting model outputs or activations, yet certain risks are inherently undetectable by inspection alone. We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use. Nonetheless, our results provide a new, model-agnostic approach for AI safety by amplifying safety guarantees from an unknown subset of models within a collection to that of a single reliable model.

Motivation: 传统AI依赖符号处理和数据驱动模型，而Physical AI试图通过物理体现和实际交互理解智能，填补理论与实际系统之间的鸿沟。

Method: 提出了六大基本原则：体现、感知、运动、学习、自主性和上下文敏感性，并将其整合为一个闭环控制系统，强调能量、信息、控制和上下文的动态交互。

Conclusion: Physical AI将智能视为身体与环境的动态耦合过程，为智能系统的设计和评价提供了新的理论基础。

Abstract: This work will elaborate the fundamental principles of physical artificial intelligence (Physical AI) from a scientific and systemic perspective. The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.
